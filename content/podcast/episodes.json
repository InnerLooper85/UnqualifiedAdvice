      "description": "Hello my dear show notes readers!\n I've missed you so. We took a little longer than expected break this time, because  someone recently turned 40 and hit it a little too hard in the fine city of New Orleans. Have you ever been? If not, you really must go. One night is not enough. Two nights are divine. Three nights are for 30-somethings. \n But back to the crux of the matter! This week, we take a look back at some dumb stuff we said about 2024 last January, have a hearty chuckle, and proceed to say some dumb stuff about the coming year. We had a blast and hope you enjoy listening in as we stare down at our big shiny crystal balls. \n Hugs and kisses,\n Old Man Sean\n Chapters\n 00:00 Reflections on Predictions for 2024\n 09:28 Lessons Learned from Past Predictions\n 12:19 Bold Predictions for 2025\n -15:22 The Future of Advertising and Market Behavior\n -17:56 Labor Market Predictions and Economic Corrections\n -21:03 Jay Powell Buys Bitcoin?\n -28:29 Anticipating Scandals in Private Equity\n -31:50 The DEI Pendulum Continues to Change Direction\n -34:06 Labor Strikes: Frequency vs. Success\n -37:28 The Future of SEO and AI Integration\n -41:05 Revamping Old Apps with AI Technology\n 48:27 Personal Growth and Life Reflections",

We compare our notes on the start of Sovereign Individual and talk about areas where the authors imaginations hit or missed the mark. The one thing we both agree on, so far: it's a long book.

We explore the importance of marking life's milestones - \"punctuations in time\" - and how they shape our sense of memory and progress.\n We ask, \"Can carefully curating your media diet help with your sanity?\" and dive into the mental toll of algorithms, social media, and the constant noise of the digital age. Along the way, we urge you to check out Tim Urban's  Monkey, and reflect on the fascinating interplay of rationality and chaos in our minds.\n Other highlights include:\n  \nThe magic and madness of Spotify Wrapped and what it reveals about us.\n Eastern vs. Western philosophies and how cultural lenses shape perception.\n Reflections on AGI, the future of sensory technologies, and what comes after the Information Age.\n Parenthood, presence, and finding joy amidst the chaos of family life.\n Manifesting intentions for 2025 and the art of asking more meaningful questions.\n  \nJoin us as we laugh, reflect, and try to make sense of the absurdity of it all.\n Things to Check Out\n  \nThe Daily Tay:  this or  this.\n Tim Urban's  Monkey,\n  \nBooks Discussed\n  \nHow to Know a Person by David Brooks\n Chatter by Ethan Kross\n The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tsu\n The WEIRDest People in the World by Joseph Henrich \n  \nCompanies Discussed\n  \nSpotify\n Apple (Apple Music, Apple One)\n Tidal\n Osmo.ai (smell digitization)\n Lux Capital (investments in innovation)\n Obsidian (note-taking app)\n  \nChapters\n  \n00:00 - Spotify Wrapped Insights\n 04:19 - Economics of Streaming Services\n 06:34 - Questions for Reflection and Personal Growth\n 14:13 - AGI and the Future of Technology\n 28:06 - Travel and Routine in Parenting\n 41:29 - Internal Dialogue and Mental Health\n 48:28 - Eastern vs. Western Philosophies\n 55:10 - Manifesting Goals for 2025\n 1:09:56 - Closing Thoughts and Humor",

      "description": "Hello to the readers of the show notes!\n This time around, Dan braves Denver traffic to bring us insights from the Smart Marketer conference he attended in October, including a very poignant question from keynote speaker Gabby Bernstein. We ruminate on his takeaways before diving into the challenges behind unit economics and shipping faced by small business owners in today's e-commerce landscape. \n While Dan was busy at his conference, I was busy being way too online. So, I brought him up to speed on the Washington Post declining to endorse a candidate for president and had an Aha! moment in the process.  Spoiler alert, we're with Jeff on this one? It's December, this is old News! you say? Maybe, but the insights remain timeless. \n We circle back to Gabby's influential message, discuss why she hadn't hit our radar until now, and look for some male analogs that may (or may not) currently exist. \n As always, thanks for tuning in!\n Cheers,\n Sean\n Books Discussed:\n  \nBooks by Gabby Bernstein \n While specific titles weren’t named, she has written several New York Times bestsellers centered on spirituality, meditation, and self-improvement.\n Possible examples currently from my content queue include The Universe Has Your Back and Super Attractor.\n  \n Give and Take by Adam Grant \n A book Dan recommended - that I have since finished and Wow! - as a valuable read for understanding reciprocity and its impact on personal and professional relationships.\n  \n Of Boys and Men by Richard Reeves \n Discussed in the context of addressing male issues and broader societal dynamics.\n  \n  \nCompanies Discussed\n  \n Smart Marketer: A digital marketing education and agency platform co-founded by Ezra Firestone and Molly Pittman. This was the central organizer of the marketing conference Daniel attended.\n  \n Native Deodorant: A brand founded by Moiz Ali, mentioned as an inspiration for Daniel to attend the conference after reading a tweet where Ali credited it as life-changing for his business.\n  \n Amazon: Discussed extensively in relation to its logistics dominance, FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) vs. FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) models, and customer expectations for shipping costs and speed.\n  \n The Washington Post/Blue Origin: Brought up during a discussion about Jeff Bezos’s decision to prevent the editorial board from endorsing political candidates, sparking debates on journalistic bias and freedom of expression. \n  \n Meta (Facebook Ads): Referenced in the context of digital marketing strategies, as Meta ads are a key tool for businesses and a focus at the conference Daniel attended.\n  \n Walmart Plus: An alternative platform that may be getting a bump from customers dissatisfied with Amazon’s business practices.\n  \n USPS (United States Postal Service): A critical element in Daniel’s shipping logistics strategy, particularly for small orders and flat-rate shipping.\n  \n Meow Wolf: Highlighted by Sean as a new immersive art experience in Houston, providing an interactive and surreal environment, with locations in Santa Fe, Denver, Dallas, and Las Vegas. \n  \n St. Arnold's Brewery: A local Houston brewery located adjacent to the new Meow Wolf Houston location.

They explore the challenges of energy efficiency in data centers and Tesla's advancements in AI and autonomous driving. The hosts also reflect on the complexities of climate change, renewable energy, and the material requirements for a sustainable future.

Sadly, I need both internet and power to make the publishing magic happen. Dan and I appreciate your patience. Anyway, onto the show notes!\n Hearts,\n Sean\n  \n Recommendations\n Dan recommends Factfulness by Hans Rolling, saying \"if you want to feel good about the world that we live in and the time that you live in, backed by data, read the book.\" Sean plans to check it out. \n Sean picked up Red Notice by Bill Browder based upon Dan's recommendation. Other than some boring details on company valuations in the post-Soviet era, it is a gripping story of evolution of the Russian society and a deep look into the problems lurking within its government. \n We referenced The Fourth Turning is Here, again. We heartily recommend this book and are currently working through it's predecessor The Fourth Turning. Expect a very special episode about this book, sometime before the first Tuesday in November. \n  \n Updates\n We asked \"will Keith Gill (a.k.a. Roaring Kitty) get sued?\" We said yes. The answer is yes. We  missed what he's done with $CHWY. \n Elon got paid!\n Interest rate futures markets, the unreliable beasts they are, have moved to predicting two cuts in 2024.",
