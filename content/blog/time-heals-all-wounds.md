**A Word of Introduction**

This post is going to be different from every post I've put up to date. There's unlikely to be another one like it.

I recently lost my father. The words that follow are a glimpse into a complicated situation. I do not expect that I'll be able to convey all my feelings. I do not expect you to fully understand. If I say something that confuses you, let's chalk it up to a difference of perspective?

**Let's Get to It**

On August 6th, I was working on words to share at my Aunt Kay's memorial. Kay was my mother's only sibling and my grandmother's oldest daughter. It was a hard time for our family.

I sent the words I had written to my dad. He had delivered the eulogy for his father and mother. I wanted his input. His response came a day after I spoke the words that I had written.

> "Good morning Sean,
> 
> I'm just checking in with you. I want to say I'm proud of you for the eulogy that you wrote and presented to your family yesterday."

On August 28th, two weeks later, my dad died. I am sitting here trying to figure out words that would again make him proud. They do not seem to exist.

**The Impression That I Get**

Mark Filipow was a mystery. He segmented every part of his life and built high walls around them. I've been trying for the better part of four decades to wrap my head around it. I doubt I will ever succeed.

I remember one morning when I was in kindergarten. I had been sleeping on the floor of my parents' bedroom (I was an absolute chicken about sleeping in my own room). I woke to the sounds of my parents arguing. Their raised voices scared me.

A few months later, my mom and I were living with my grandparents. I was in my second school. My dad was in prison.

This was the first time I practiced burying my dad. He did his best to keep himself alive in my young mind. He collected all the cereal box-tops he could get his hands on during kitchen duty \[1\]. Once a month, I'd get a package with every box-top a kid could want and an audio tape of him reading me a story. I was unaware of his transgressions and I was happy to have story time. But as happy as his voice could make me in those short moments, there were long hours of doubt and sadness.

A few years later, my mom got remarried. She met an amazing guy named Burk, who had two sons of his own. It was very Brady bunch. One of my new stepbrothers was older, the other younger. And I went from being an only child to a middle child.

Unfortunately, I had become accustomed to the life of an only child. I was not only an only child, but an only child who got to live with grandma and grandpa. The prospect of having a new stepdad, two stepbrothers, and another new school was scary. I had to learn how to adapt.

To help get through it, I did everything in my power to be a little shit. Regardless of what Burk or my Mom would say, I had to contradict it. Thankfully, that period only lasted a little over a decade... or two.  Despite my attitude, Burk, while flying by the-seat-of-his-pants, showed me how to be a pretty good dude. Mom also helped <3.

**Fool Me Twice**

Everything I am telling you is from memory. However, our memories are unreliable narrators. The next solid memory I have of my dad is circa fourth grade. This was the beginning of semi-weekly-weekend trips from Lafayette to Indianapolis. 

My dad was getting back on his feet. Initially, he spent stints staying with Eric and Keith, his older and younger brothers. This was great for me. It meant spending time with all my cousins. We were all within four years of each other, so we had enough in common to have fun.

Later on, my dad began to date again. Here is a brief summary of women that I remember being important to my father, after Mom divorced him.

Looks a bit like a fucked-up logic puzzle, no?

After the tumult of the early 90's, my dad did an okay job of getting his head straight and trying to move on with life. We progressively grew closer, despite the parade of different places I laid my head. Time with dad was the only factor in the equation that mattered. As long as dad-time was going on, I was happy.

**A Spooky Halloween**

My dad bought a lot of unreliable cars. One winter, the first with Kathy, we went on a weekend trip to Chicago in a rusted-out, orange station wagon. I can't tell you the make. The rust had consumed anything that one could use to identify the car. I am not convinced the car was actually painted orange. It could have been white, with the oxides bleeding through. The floor featured a 3-inch hole. It was as perfect for ditching empty soda cans as it was useless for protecting us from the cold, wet winter roads. Kathy and her daughters drove on their own.

Kathy and my dad were both divorcees with kids. At the time they met, Kathy lived in the small Indiana town of Crawfordsville. I am, to this day unclear on how they met. My father lived in "big city" Indianapolis an hour away. I do not know how those paths crossed... but they did! Randomness is lovely. After they met, they planned a winter trip for a whole gaggle of kids to a hotel by an airport in Chicago. Who'd have thunk it?

The airport Holiday Inn had Mike Tyson's Punch Out in the room, a pool and a vending machine. I, an eight-year-old boy, was content.

My dad spent the majority of his days meeting with people that Kathy, her daughters, or I would never meet. We sat by the pool. One night, we enjoyed a meal at Portillos, which dad assured us was prime Chicago cuisine. He wasn't wrong.

Kathy and my dad dated for a while, at least a year. He helped her and her daughters find a house on 103rd street in Indy. We'd spend weekends there hanging out, watching X-files and playing chess. It was a good time.

Eventually, they split. When they did, Kathy and her daughters, Tammy and DJ (probably not her birth name), became memories. At least for a while.

My dad dated a few other women, all notable in their own regard, over the coming years. Eventually, he was single again. Oddly, he found a place to lay his head that he was already accustomed to. 

Kathy had moved on from her house on 103rd street. She was looking to sell but could not find a buyer.

For some reason, dad moved back in. I found it incredibly odd at first. He had helped her find the house. Now she was renting it out to him? Probably below market rate, if I had to guess. Actually, if I had to guess, he was staying there for free. They had started dating again.

One Halloween weekend during this period sticks out in my mind. My dad's day-to-day car (probably a Nissan) was "in the shop," as it had been for several months. To get around, my dad had been borrowing his neighbor's truck.

It was in this truck I found myself sitting on Halloween night in 1998. We decided to go see a midnight showing of Silence of the Lambs, a little-known film at the time in Indiana.

On the way to the theater, we stopped to get a bite at a White Castle and my dad got out of the truck to take a phone call. White Castle's burgers are small and notoriously quick to eat. I ended up sitting in the cab of this borrowed truck while dad was on the phone. I decided to touch EVERYTHING!

In my effort to touch EVERYTHING, I opened the glovebox. It fell open with a thud. Staring me in the face was the most realistic toy gun I had ever seen. I picked it up.

It. Was. Not. A. Toy.

My anxiety going to sleep that night was not because of Hannibal Lecter. It was because of that damned revolver.

**Buttering the Crust**

I do not know how my father met Marianne. I don't care. The years when dad was with Marianne are among the best I can remember.

During the time with Marianne, my dad was stable. He was the best Mark that he could be. I am pretty sure he was taking his meds regularly. I suspect, he did not like the way his meds made him feel.

Thanks to Marianne, I experienced things that would only be available to kids with a terminal illness and an in with the United Way. I sat in the luxury boxes at Colts' games more times than I can count. Marianne taught me how to hit a 3 wood at a swanky Indianapolis golf club. I got to experience Universal Studios multiple times. I played roughly 9 million hours of Ms. Pacman on and old school arcade machine in Marianne's basement. I got to have a second childhood with my dad. A weird experience for a 13-year old.

I cannot thank her enough. 

**The Second Burial**

**or: An Unexpected Estate Sale**

In my freshman year at Purdue, my uncle Keith called me. I hadn't seen my dad in a couple of years. Keith asked if I wanted to come see if there was any of "dad's crap" that I wanted. I didn't know there was any crap to be wanted or had.

About a year before, I'd heard Mom talking on the phone with relatives. I knew something was up, but never got all the details. In short, my dad had pulled a disappearing act.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The groundwork for the latest act was laid years before. Mark had split from Marianne shortly after the death of his father, Walter, or Grampie as I knew him. Grampie's funeral is the first time I recall crying in public. I remember parts of the eulogy my father delivered, steadfast and tearless, to this day. I remember after the service going to an arcade and playing video games with Dad. I think he stopped using his meds shortly after that.

Soon, when I'd go to see Dad, we weren't staying in Marianne's choice digs. Rather, every Friday and Saturday night was spent in a room at the Microtel on Michigan Avenue and I-465. We spent the evenings at a BW-3 (#IYKYK) playing trivia, two-handed euchre, or Scrabble. Back in the room, if we weren't too full of wings, we'd order a pizza from Jack's, who made the best-bad-pizza money could buy.

One year, dad finally started renting a place of his own. It was half of a nice house near the campus of Butler University, Dad's alma mater. The half that he occupied was a nice 2-bed, 2-bath with ton's of space that he never could hope to fill, but he tried. He had a room for each of us, even though I was only there a few nights a month. He got me a nice stable queen bed to sleep in. His bed was a cheap AeroBed that he, for some-reason-about-back-problems, loved. He bought a new 50" projection TV with a decked out stereo system. He bought a VitaMix so he could blend anything and everything.

I'd had recently gotten my license, so I was driving down to see him more often. After some rough years, it seemed like he was normalizing and hitting a good stride.

Then it fell apart. One night when I was there, his AeroBed went flat, so he crashed in my room. I had drifted off only to wake to the sound of him hitting his head with his fist and muttering. The next morning, I woke to the sound of him talking outside with his landlord.

"The money is in escrow, you know how it is? I'll have it to you soon."

That was one of the last times I saw my dad for several years.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A few years later, Keith called to inform me that they had put a bunch of my Dad's crap in storage after he disappeared. They had decided to go ahead and clear it out and get rid of the bill for the storage unit.

One crisp autumn morning, I found myself standing outside of a storage shed. It was full of things that were a mystery to me. I had no idea my family had cleared out Dad's place and put these things in storage.

I asked myself, "What could possibly be left?"

It was a lot. I ended up with that big projection TV and a VitaMix. Both of which moved with me to Houston years later. Eventually, I donated the TV to bar that opened down the street from my first home. I still use the VitaMix several times a year.

**A Weekend in Chicago, a Ride on a Train, a Serious Discussion**

**Or: A Brief Understanding**

For a good number of years, Dad would take me up to Chicago for our weekend together. The times we spent together in Chicago will forever be favorites in my mind. We saw the Cubs at Wrigley, the Sox at Comiskey, the car show at McCormick, improv at Second City and so much more.

Though going by car would be a few minutes quicker, we'd often take the train. The train ride from Chicago to Lafayette, where I would get off, is at least three hours long.

One of these trips coincided with a high school research paper I had to write. I had picked Bipolar Disorder as my topic. My father, a sufferer of Bipolar Disorder, was a captive primary-source.

Prior to the trip, he had agreed to help me. I think we both dreaded that conversation. We spent the whole weekend in Chicago doing anything but thinking about that paper that I had to write.

The hours that night, between Chicago and Lafayette, were the closest I have ever been to my father. It is a shame that occurred about 25 years ago and never again.

We talked about his mental illness. We talked about how it made him feel. We talked about how his medication impacted his thoughts and actions. In all this, for a brief few minutes, I think I understood his troubles.

**The Third Burial**

I am happily married to a wonderful lady named Jamie. She is a rock for me, a perfect counterbalance. When I asked Jamie to marry me in New Orleans on December 23, 2012, it was the second time I had asked such a question. Thankfully, the first person to say yes, later broke my heart with a dear John note and the ring left on a counter in my apartment. That heartbreak steeled me. It was what needed to happen, even if I didn't want it. As always, the people you are closest with know what is best for you. Especially when it is painful to hear.

When I had decided to first get engaged, it was at the ripe young age of 19 (I do not recommend doing this). Having made up my mind, I decided to tell Dad to get his input. It was my birthday weekend and the lodging du jour was a hotel by the Circle in Indianapolis. After dinner at Bazbeaux Pizza, we were walking by the monuments and I broke the news to him. I expected... some level of excitement, I guess. What I got was "Oh, that's cool! Congratulations." followed by a prompt subject change.

That engagement did not last. When it ended, I was heartbroken

The day after my first engagement ended, Dad and I already had dinner plans - burgers at Max & Erma's. The engagement had ended less than a day prior. He was the first person I told.

I don't know why I expected anything more, but I had. It broke my heart even more when I told him what was happening and he said "It may just be 'her time of the month,' women get crazy," and changed subjects.

This was the third time I buried my father. I realized that in my biggest moments of need, he couldn't stand up and help.

**The Relief**

For years, I was the bond between the past and the present, when it came to my father. Family would ask me, "how is your dad doing?" A simple enough question, sure. But one that has brought me much stress.

"Dad is driving a rusted-out P.O.S. truck that's filled with loose handguns and women from bed to ceiling."

This is not an answer you want to give your mother, assuming you wish to keep seeing your father. So, you don't give her that answer. Instead you say,

"We had a great weekend in Chicago!"

Then you shuffle your feet as your mother looks at you, assessing if you are okay.

You say "No really! The... hotdogs were delicious!" You remembered eating hotdogs on your trip. This was not an untruth.

Mom seems okay with the truth you shared. The rest of the truth is there for you to hold onto and share later.

**Bipolar Opposites**

My father and I, I have finally realized, are opposites of a strange sort.

He loved everyone. I love everyone.

Not all love is equal or all that different.

Mark suffered from a mental illness, Bipolar Disorder. I've been receiving treatment for General Anxiety Disorder since 2015. Watching my father deal with Bipolar scared me the-shit-out-of-me. I am hyper aware of every possible misstep I take and constantly second-guess myself.

Before I started getting treatment, it was crippling for me. Now, I see it as an asset. My brain works in ways that most peoples don't. I like that.

Not all mental illness is equal or all that different. My dad held everything within himself. But, he was a pretty cool guy at a party. I am not so great at parties... but... I've laid it all out there in ways he never would.

At times, my dad's brain told him he could do no wrong.  This is the mania. It was during these times when his intentions wrote the checks that his actions could never cash. He wanted nothing more than to help and make others’ lives better. I think that is a pretty admirable goal.

Much of the time, my brain tells me I can do no right. I have to fight to convince it that is wholly untrue. I want to help others through action and words. I want to make their lives better. I think I know where I get a bit of that from.
