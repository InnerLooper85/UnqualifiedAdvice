This August brought the summer break that broke me. I was gifted with two weeks off from school. I wanted to spend more of the month writing to you with my additional time. Unfortunately, I had to write two eulogies instead.

I do have this post for you and I think it's pretty good. Please, start from the end \[1\] if you want to get the most out of it. Once you’ve done that come back here and…

**Give Me Your Eyes**

Some cool stuff has been happening for Fig Social Capital the last month. As of August 11, 2022, Fig is registered in Texas as an investment advisory firm. We can legally open for business. Though, we're (I’m) not there yet.

The hurdles of individual and firm registration with the state are complete. That is great! It's kinda a big deal! Maybe?

It's also not that big of a deal. Education, passing a test, and licensing are important. But, those things are merely a foundation. Off of that foundation, Fig (Sean) must build effective systems to manage the business. A robust set of systems and processes are a cornerstone to creating value.

So... we're not open, but...

**I Need Sunshine**

For Fig to succeed, I need your eyes. I need your enthusiasm and pushback. My ideas will neither work nor be able to grow in a vacuum.

I am starting a small business. On average, 65% of small businesses fail within their first five years . I've taken risks in putting my work and thoughts out for all to judge. It's been scary at times. I am hopeful that by learning, trying, and failing in public I can earn your trust.

You've taken a risk in spending your life-minutes reading my writing. The first week I posted this... whatever it is... I got about 10 people to read. The last couple of posts, over 200 people have read. Seeing that number has taught me what it means to feel humbled. Thank you.

**Nobody Gives a Damn**

Over summer break I finished Daniel Kahneman's _Thinking Fast and Slow_. The book triggered many valuable revelations for me. But, due to recency bias, I'd like to focus on his closing thought.

> Decision makers are sometimes better able to imagine the voices of present gossipers and future critics than to hear the hesitant voice of their own doubts. They will make better choices when they trust their critics to be sophisticated and fair, and when they expect their decision to be judged by how it was made, not only by how it turned out.

This thought describes my worst fears. I'm opening a business that will help people grow their saved time (money). There are lots of important decisions that will be made on my advice. Law requires that I create a memo for every investment decision made. Many of my recommendations will be toward diversified ETFs. Some will be for individual stocks. All will be documented in individual memos and Fig's quarterly reports.What if, despite any amount of effort, a decision doesn't work out?

Well, it's going to happen. I guarantee it.

My hope is that my clients, like you, take the time to read what I write and consider my thought process.

Please keep (or start) sharing!

**I'll Believe in Anything…**

Since I started dreaming and talking about Fig to people, the responses have been enlightening. I've realized, is there is a lot of potential energy stored-up in the form of peoples’ goals. Those goals are often achievable, but the they're facing friction. Those who haven't started working on their goals face the worst kind of friction: static friction.

What is static friction and why is it the worst? It all goes back to inertia and Newton's laws. A body at rest tends to stay at rest, and such. Believe it or not, this works also on forces acting _between_ objects. Imagine you are pushing a couch that weights 100 lbs. There are two coefficients of friction between the bottom of the couch and the floor, static and dynamic. The static coefficient may be something like 0.20 and the dynamic coefficient could be 0.10. What would this mean? For the couch weighing 100 lbs, you'd have to apply 20 lbs of force to get the couch moving at first. But, once it is moving, you only have to apply 10 lbs of force to keep it moving.

People and their ideas have the same forces of friction acting on them. I am working to grow Fig so that we can help anyone overcome friction and achieve their goals. The first step is them believing in themselves and making the first push.

**…If You'll Believe in Anything\***

\*Me.

I want this to be in no uncertain terms. I need you to believe in me and my mission.

I'm proud to report, I am almost there! As of this writing, I have only 14 Monday nights to spend in class. More importantly, I have zero Wednesday or Thursday night classes.

The first half of the term, I'm taking Strategic Management. I have to say, I'm looking forward to this one. In my time as a line manager, I've been subjected to the whims of many strategic projects and decisions. Some were good. Some were toxic-dumpster-fires. I am hoping learning about how those decisions are best made will give me new perspective. When you work down in the weeds, it's hard to realize there's a whole forest out there.

Notes

\[1\] Sometimes I include visual elements in these newsletters. This time, I'm including an audio element. Due to my limited budget and the complexities of music licensing, you're gonna have to lend me a hand. I wrote this piece with the song "I'll Believe in Anything" by Wolf Parade in mind. Queue it up before or while you give this a read.
