### The First Fruit

The start of February found me finishing up my first quarterly reports for Fig's clients. Clients who have actually paid for my services, thanks to our first billing cycle in January. That feels pretty good to be able to put in writing. In fourteen months, Fig Social Capital went from an idea to an actual business with paying customers. Granted, it is not yet a profitable business, but it is a business, nonetheless. Growing something that exists feels less daunting than making something from whole cloth.

I had an idea for a business where I would be doing things that I like doing. To be precise, the work required to achieve the business' core function is work I enjoy. This is generally true for most entrepreneurs? I mean, bakeries tend not to be started by people who don't like to bake.

And yet, much of the work of starting a bakery is not actually baking. Setting up a production space? Not baking. Passing a health department inspection? Not baking! Creating an LLC, setting up a payment system, hiring employees? Not baking! Are they related to baking? Kinda? Does having skill at and enjoying baking mean you like or know how to do the other things? Hell no!

As with a baker and their dream bakery, there are a lot of related-but-not-actually-investing tasks in launching an investing firm.

I DID THOSE THINGS!

Having more time to focus on my process and research will be nice. Being legally and functionally able to get compensated for doing work I love will, hopefully, change my life. Maybe?

### **Setbacks**

Last April, I proudly announced submitting a trademark application for Fig Social Capital. Last month, I received news that, after an initial review, things were looking good! The Examiner at the Patent Office was ready to send the application for publication. My hopes of it getting accepted were high! After waiting for almost nine months, any news felt like good news.
