I've been spending a lot of time talking to this one dude on the phone. If this was the 80's, we'd be long broke on the long distance charges from MCI.

Lately, our conversations have swirled around the drain of midlife.

I think we both are looking for meaning in our own lives, hoping being a little vulnerable may open us up to some healing truth.

I think we are looking for a place. It’s the place we thought we wanted to end up. The funny thing is, I think we did make it there, it just looks different than what we expected.

So,

> There was a place  
> And the name of the place escapes me  
> When I can't remember  
> It irritates me  
> Could be I can't remember  
> Could be I choose to not  
> Let's move the song along  
> And try to find the plot

I am pushing 40. And like many [actual writers before me](https://overcast.fm/+ABIih-vXfFg/21:59), I am struggling with the dystopia of my own demise. I think a lot of people go through the same as they near some number that seems significant. We’ve watched our elders go through it, but somehow getting older catches us off-guard.

I hear you, Mother.

Father.

Aunt.

Et tu, Cool Uncle?!?

I hear your laughter.

Some of us, namely Sean Filipow, are struggling with the fact that we may be closer to retirement than the beginning of our careers \[1\]. And as we are sitting here, in the middle \[2\], we realize we aren’t where we expected.

So I find myself here, in the assayer’s office, laying out hard earned coin against missed experiences. Triangulating the _what-ifs._

But my worth is not in a vacuum.

> There was a girl and I don't know her name either  
> She gave me love and I swore I'd never leave her  
> If I did I'd come back someday and find her  
> Maybe I will, I should write down a reminder

I used to think of my worth as all the places I had the potential to go. And that only by visiting all those destinations and realizing all of that potential, a truly impossible goal, would I live up to my self-worth.

I wanted to do it all.

I now realize my worth lies in the path I chose. The doors that I closed have no value.

They are behind me.

The doors still on my path are as valuable as any door I ever had available to me in the first place.

The path I chose put strong allies at my side. I may not be solving the worlds’ problems by inventing some new technology, but I am solving my loved ones’ problems by being there for them.

With my allies at my side, I can look to my future and be excited.

**Notes**

\[1\] I have a firm plan to “retire” by 55, but who really knows what retirement means. I don’t plan to stop working… I just plan to work differently. Also, [my career started at 13](https://blacktuesdays.substack.com/p/everything-is-a-bead). I am already 27 years in and I can’t ever see giving it up entirely.

\[2\]

\[3\] This one is for Jamie (thanks for supporting me), John, Joan, Aaron, Aaron, Chris, Josh, and Dan and everyone else who has or ever will turn 40. Except for Bo Burnham. He can do his own shit for dealing with 40, which I look forward to [consuming in 2030](https://open.spotify.com/track/7q2vosjX9aP8XxKFs7nakK?si=e1b2526579674122).
