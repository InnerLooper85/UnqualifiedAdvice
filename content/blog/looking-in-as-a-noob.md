### Appetizer: a Confession

Hello dear readers!

I think I can say that now? Several dozen of you have already made my day by clicking subscribe…

Go ahead, make my day.

…and several dozen more seem to find my posts by other mysterious means. At least, that is what the traffic data would indicate. Who am I to argue with traffic data?

When I started _Goodbye, Black Tuesdays_ I was looking for a regular creative outlet where I could click publish on something that I thought was meaningful, every week or two. What I’ve found is that writing something meaningful is as challenging as it is rewarding. Keeping a regular schedule is difficult. My standards get strangely higher as I look at the _**Publish**_ button.

I suspect you do not _mind_ me not publishing garbage, for the sake of keeping up a schedule.

But, maybe you do? If you do, then I’d like a word:

_Psst!!! See… the thing is, this writing stuff… it’s hard work. It can be a bit lonely, too._ _So, I’ve been cheating on you with my buddy Dan. I mean, I still love **you**. And I’ll always be back. But if you ever miss me, check your favorite [pod-catcher](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unqualified-advice/id1745972546) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfli7TFXIhxF5GJPCrl5SsQ) every two weeks for some totally **Unqualified Advice**._

_Yeah, that’s right. It’s a podcast. In our most recent episode, we talk a bit more about my story from below, how we’re using AI to make life more efficient and take a dive into memetics._

_Sound intriguing? Then, maybe check it out?_

### Main Course: a Lesson

My buddy Dan owns a _small company_. By necessity, he has to purchase inputs from external suppliers. These suppliers tend to be larger, more sophisticated companies. The current tariff policy and risk of escalation has put Dan on high-alert, driving him to evaluate alternatives and think about re-sourcing where his products are made. But he’s been unsure of what to look for to identify good suppliers, so he asked for my thoughts.

Unlike Dan, I work for a _large company_. Large companies, again by necessity, buy things from smaller, less sophisticated companies. To make sure we — _the corporate we_ — are buying the right things from the right companies, we'll send people to go check out the companies selling us things. This is called an audit.

I have, by great fortune, been sent to see many suppliers.

I sat down and made a list. As far as I can recall, I've had behind the scenes tours of 61 different production facilities professionally. If you add in the off-the-job tours of various libation producers, that easily doubles.

The experience has taught me that I enjoy thinking about process.

How does raw material A get transformed into finished product B? Can byproduct C be transformed into finished product D?

That sort of thing.

The experience has taught me investigative skills. When you are going in to assess the competence of people putting on their best show, how do know if they are doing a good job?

Remember the Latin! _Nullius in verba_.

_**Nullius in verba**_ - take no one's word for it ([don’t even take my word for it](https://royalsociety.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/)). Something to remember is that technical specialists can be kinda lonely, at least when it comes to having people to talk about their work with. Outside of the workplace, they don't have a lot of people to brag or complain to who will understand their everyday struggles. If you are sniffing out a company, use this to your advantage. Often, the technical employees will describe the rose tinted vision that they are aiming for. But what you hear won’t necessarily be the truth of how things are actually done.

People, by nature, want to brag on themselves and tell you a rosy picture. Let them.

_**And take notes!**_

When they tell you how it _should_ be, listen and write it down.

Also, resist your own nature. When visiting a manufacturing facility, there is a natural inclination to start with a tour of the production floor. Unless you already know what you should expect to see, don't start there. Start with the technical people in a conference room. Pick something they do, something you don't understand and ask them about it. Get them to tell you as much as possible about what you _will_ see and what it _**should**_ \[1\] look like. Ask them to help you understand what you should expect to see.

_**Take more notes.**_

Once they have put into words what they should do, have them show you what they actually do. Those notes you have been taking? It’s time to use them. Bring them along and look for discrepancies.

Why do this? If you know something, a person, a process, an emotion, you should be able to put it into words. Otherwise you don’t really know it.

What you are evaluating when visiting a supplier is how well they _know their shit!_ If a supplier cannot describe what you will see on a tour, then show the things they said they would show you, they do not understand their-own-selves.

If you can figure out how to do this, you can make a pretty good assessment of most anything, business or otherwise.

### Lagniappe: Some Philosophy

As I mentioned, I’ve been through enough manufacturing facilities to notice subtle trends. Based on observation, column budgets have been inversely correlated to safety budgets in manufacturing facilities over time.

I spent a recent Thursday in a 1,000,000 square foot production facility.

_One million square feet!_

It was built by Michelin \[2\] to mix rubber but is now in the hands of a startup looking to revolutionize restaurant ratings.

Just kidding, a different rubber company bought the place.

This new elastic startup came into existence when Michelin decided to abandon the facility. The workers there realized there was still a lot of _value_ in the old, drafty factory and heavy machines that were being left behind.

And so, some of them decided to buy this strangely beautiful place.

This building is 5 floors, 200,000 square feet each. Each floor is lined with Roman columns — plinths and all! — supporting the floors above. This building was a good 100 years old and clearly had a _column budget_, not a cent for lighting, and I’d guess somehow-less-than-zero dollars budgeted for safety.

If you were to make this space today, the columns would be steel I-beams. _Super cost-effective_. And you would take every reasonable — if not every possible — precaution to ensure that people go home with the parts they had, when then arrived at work.

But despite being built in the early 1900s, this place is still manufacturing high quality product on machinery that has long since been paid for (a.k.a. it’s been fully depreciated), which has given this company the cash to invest in vastly improved safety equipment along with one of the better R&D setups I’ve seen for a company of their size. And, rumor has it, that they will soon be leaving their ancient facility for something more modern. I’m sure they’ll spend more on high end equipment than columns.

On the other end of the spectrum, I’ve seen companies construct brand new facilities, sinking tens of millions of United States Dollars into faux-Pantheons, because they saw potential value in entering a brand new market. These companies start from zero, trying to go to infinity in a year. Their technology and facilities are impressive, with lots of bright lights and automation. You know what else is impressive? The annual depreciation line on their P&L — a.k.a. their equipment isn’t all paid for. In my experience, these types of places have about a 10% survival rate after 5 years.

Take that for what you will.

### Notes

\[1\] Or _shall,_ which is a [very important distinction.](https://www.iso.org/foreword-supplementary-information.html) Ask if they have an ISO cert. If they answer yes, you kinda own them for a bit. I want to add a footnote to a footnote here, but I will resist and leave you with a screenshot of why _should vs. shall_ is important.

\[2\] To be clear, I was _told_ by the employees working at the facility that it was built by Michelin. Some internet sleuthing later proved this to be inaccurate. Again, _nullius in verba!_ But I am leaving it in for narrative reasons and to provide sufficient obfuscation for the parties involved, though they were lovely and competent folks, working at a well-run company.
