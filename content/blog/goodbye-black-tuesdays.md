**#MBALife**

I'm almost there! As of this writing, I'm down to eight Monday nights. Only eight short weeks of stressing about our Capstone Project. Our Capstone Class is a continuation of last term's Strategic Management. Though most of the last eight weeks has been dedicated to PESTELs and Porter's Five Powers, I also got neck deep in intermodal tanks.

What's that you say? What is an intermodal tank and why would anyone care? Great question! Intermodal tanks look something like the picture above and are useful for shipping all manner of commodities. For the capstone project, we are working with a company that leases tanks. We had a short presentation on intermodal tanks and the company's business model. Then they set us free on two short questions, that are very hard to answer:

1) What are the best growth opportunities for commodity products?

2) Where is that growth likely to happen?

That's it.... That's the prompt and input we received for 16 weeks worth of work. I have rarely had the opportunity to work on something quite so open ended. It has been enlightening to see where my frustrations have come from. Even in my job-job, I usually have clear parameters for the goal of a project and where the answer lies. On this one, the whole world was our resource and we have been left to figure it out.

As the sole member of the team from the finance program, the mathy-stuff ended up on my plate. It's been good experience. To try to come up with an answer, I've spent more weekend hours than my wife would prefer looking at FRED.

For most, the question that you have in your mind is likely, "Who's FRED and why have you been studying him so intently?"

FRED stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data. It is the [St. Louis Federal Reserve's wonderful database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) that is a candy store for the kid in every economist. When you want to look at historic data to help build models of the future, it is a great resource.

But we are talking about creating a strategy. The problem with FRED, and any similar source, is that people use history to predict the future. And these predictions are what guide strategy. When you have so much history at your fingertips, it's hard to ignore it. I get it.

As it turns out, history is an unreliable narrator. Things tend to change. Those changes tend to be unpredictable.

"The last time X event occurred, Y event followed," is something you hear a lot. This advice, more often than not, feeds of our nature to buy into anecdotal evidence. Let's look at how:

1\. Someone asks you, "Remember, “X-thing" happening before?!"

2\. You remember "X-thing" happening.

3\. You're asked to remember the last time "X-thing" happened.

4\. You do that.

5\. You're asked, "do you remember "Y-thing" happening shortly after?"

6\. "Yes"

7\. "So, you see how X leads to Y?"

8\. "I don't want to seem like an idiot, so yes obviously I see how X leads to Y! Buy me lots of shares of Y!?!?!"

Do you see the problem here? It’s our human brains. They are deterministic. They thrive off of stories... cause and effect. If something really good or really bad happens, we construct stories to explain why. When something unexpected happens, but someone has a good story for why, we'll buy in. It makes us feel better know know _why_.

Unfortunately, for a lot of those really good or really bad events... random happenstance is what allowed them. A lot of luck. But our brains cannot account for luck. If we use history to devine a strategy for the future, we need to know that history is nothing but the echo that will trigger a future avalanche.

**Cultivating Figs**

It's fall in Houston. Fall in Houston means I get to take my laptop out on the porch and sit here to work. I do a lot of good thinking on the porch, away from the things inside that can steal the focus of my attention.

I started thinking about the idea of Fig Social Capital about a year ago. At the time, I was doing a lot of sitting on the porch. After thinking it out, I put together a rough business plan and scheduled a pitch meeting. I invited some MBA cohorts, friends, family ([R.I.P. Dad](https://open.substack.com/pub/slowvsm/p/time-heals-all-wounds?r=11xjyw&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)) and a few trusted people from my day-job. The presentation was imperfect. I was nervous. I stumbled more than I would have liked. I was doing everything for the first time and was terrified. When it was over, I was sure pitch was terrible and everyone thought my ideas followed suit.

The response that followed was not that. Sure, not everyone who attended rang me up to give me praise. Some never said anything about it after that day. But a good number of people reached out with encouraging words. They said they saw something in the idea and gave me ideas for improvement.

I went to work.

In December, I founded Fig Social Capital LLC. I applied for a trademark (still pending). I started studying for exams.

At the start of this year, I began writing for this newsletter. After a bunch of terrible drafts, I posted my first (still not very good) piece in March.

I like to imagine that I have gotten better since I started practicing \*writing on the internet\*. One thing I know, is that I have a better idea of where I am going with this than when I started.

When I first dreamed up the business plan of Fig Social Capital, there were three tiers to the model.

1) Personal Financial Advisement Services

2) Small Business Support and Consulting

3) Financial Education Support Services

The first tier has been progressing better than I could have dreamed. I nailed the Series 65. With the help of some great attorneys, I set up Fig's procedures and processes. I set up a website and began marketing. And, most importantly for the bottom line, I've signed my first clients. I am by no means "there" yet, but I'm on my way. If things keep up, I may soon have my fix costs covered, at least.

The second and third tier of Fig are as important to me as the first. If I can't get around to those tiers, then there is no point in the first tier. I was afraid I wouldn't ever get around to them.

Unfortunately for my natural doubts, I am a lucky SOB. Fig has found our first small business client, based right here in Houston. It's not necessarily huge. But, it is progress towards leveraging the power of my idea to reach my dreams.

In another blow to my self-doubt, I am working on "Untitled Project" with a dear friend. If our Scrum cycle holds, we'll have the thing named and Fig will start taking a swing at that third tier by year's end.

As part of this new thing, you, dear reader who is still here at the end, can expect some minor changes. The newsletter will be undergoing a bit of a rebrand. We'll still be cross-posting here on Substack, but the main home will move to our new platform. The changes will take time, but I am excited about them so wanted to tell you.

In short, you can say goodbye to _Thoughts on the Value Stream_ and hello to _Goodbye, Black Tuesdays_.
