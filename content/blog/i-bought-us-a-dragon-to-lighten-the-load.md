Sometimes you have to put things on hold. I’m sorry. I put you on hold. I hope you understand. Here’s a song that you should listen to while you read the rest of this nonsense.

**Where Have I Been?**

The last I wrote, I was very busy deluding myself that things were moving smoothly. They were not. I thought, since I no longer had to worry about the school-stuff, I may have some newfound free-time.

The strangest thing happened...

I was wrong!

I've missed writing to you. But I couldn't.

I've been rotating between two mindsets: stuck and busy. Mostly, when it comes to writing, I've been stuck. If I said I haven't been writing lately because, "I've been busy," that was an excuse.

You see. This thing happened. It fucked me up. It fucked me up much worse than I was expecting. I'm gonna talk about it later. I've almost got the words written to share with my editor \[1\]. You’ll be next.

Today, I just want to kick the tires and rebuild some momentum.

**Let's Get SWOTty**

Have I ever told you the story of how I became a manager? I think it happened because of a conversation held in my windowless office back in early 2014 \[2\].

At the time, I was working as my business line's only employee in Houston, making as many different hats look as fashionable as I could. I worked for a tiny group within my company. We were actually part of a company acquired by a larger company that was then, itself, acquired. Our tiny group produced about $20 million in annual revenue. I realize this sounds like a lot, but relative to the $45.3 billion of my company's overall revenue it was tiny. If you make $100,000 a year, you could imagine my business line's contribution being $44.44 to your annual paycheck. You probably would't miss us if we died.

I knew I wanted to move up and I knew the only way to do that was to get better. I had been tasked with growing our market share. As a trained mechanical engineer, this was **not** in my wheelhouse \[3\].

I studied.

I learned that to grow our business, I had to figure out where we fit in the market. And... I was back to square one — thank you, engineering degree!

Then I found something my engineering brain latched onto. A Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat, or SWOT, diagram. This made _sense_. To figure out how to grow, I had to figure out what we were good at, what we were bad at, and what opportunities our were open for us to grow into. Using this tool, I created a plan to take us to $60 million in annual revenue by 2016 (or $133.33 of a annual $100K salary).

Pleased with my plan (and the [patent](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/89/4c/ef/9eb3d2d657ec4f/US10670153.pdf) or [two](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/99/ef/f0/996eaf4d5ae216/WO2014201205A1.pdf) I helped create to enable it), I thought maybe it would be worth SWOTting my-own-damn-self.

So, I did.

It brought me comfort to admit the things I was good at and the things I needed to work on. It helped me to think about the opportunities and threats (things external to myself) to see how they could impact my path.

This brings us back to the windowless office in early 2014. My boss, who worked at our plant in Racho Cucamonga, CA was in town.

She only came to town 3-4 times a year and this visit coincided with our annual review process. My annual review was set to be in person, during her stay.

The corporate employee review process sucks. I have had only a handful of reviews that left me satisfied. This was the first.

Rather than going through our standard review packet, I lead with my printed SWOT. I talked through each point. Explaining the ins-and-outs of how I rated myself was empowering. My boss had written a rather glowing review, which she shared after. The critiques of myself were things that she could either never know or bring herself to say. She proceeded to give me opportunities to learn more in the areas where I said I needed to grow.

Later, she moved on to a bigger role and left me behind with a sub-par manager. But, I am lucky if nothing else. A role on her team soon opened-up. She was quick to reach out to me to fill it.

The job, managing a manufacturing product line, was never something I had dreamed of doing. At first I wanted to turn it down. I had seen the abuse the manufacturing manager at our small plant went through. That abuse did not seem appealing.

So, I went to bed, confident I would not take the role. At 8:00 AM the next morning, I called my former boss. I told her I was in. At 8:10, I called my current boss and told him I was taking a sick-day. I hadn't slept all night.

I found myself managing a team of people for the first time. I think first time managers are usually given a small team. My first team was 72 people large.

I was OUT OF MY DEPTH. I was drowning. Why had my boss wanted me for this role?!?! "There must be more qualified people who knew what they are doing," I said to myself.

Years later, I realize that a) no there weren’t, nobody is qualified and b) it was that damned SWOT. I had problem solving and communicating listed as two of my strengths. I had demonstrated a strength (self-awareness) that I didn't even know was a skill. This turns out to have been an effective toolkit.

I don't remember what my weaknesses were, but I know being a manager for the last 6 years has improved upon whatever they were.

**Meet My Dragon**

Since that first self-SWOT back in 2014, I've repeated the exercise about every 6-months (okay, okay, I skipped 2020).

At the beginning of last year, 2022, my MBA studies put me in marketing class. We spent a whole week learning about SWOT diagrams. As I worked through the coursework, I had an idea.

At work, it was our annual performance review period. I decided to share my own (edited) personal SWOT with my engineers, a subset of my larger team.

The results I got from sharing my personal SWOT with my manager were positive. The results from sharing it with my team were pure magic.

My weaknesses rapidly became strengths. Opportunities started to be realized at a faster pace. And _my_ strengths started to become _our_ strengths.

If you are a manager, I highly recommend doing this.

**Pics or it Didn't Happen**

To inspire you, here's how you do it:

1) Make something like this (I recommend doing it on paper).

2) Be alone. Reflect.

3) Populate.

4) Share.

5) Discuss.

I could speak to each of these bullets far longer than any of you would care to read. I don’t feel like bragging, so I’ll skip the strengths. I honestly don’t feel like feeding my self-doubt. So, I’ll skip my weaknesses.

What is most important, perhaps, is what is not here anymore. This is where the magic happened. A year ago, _delegation_ and _time-management_ were amongst my weaknesses. They are not yet a strength, but I don’t think they qualify as weaknesses any longer. I told my team I needed help. They stepped up.

Next year, maybe I can get _self-doubt_ off the list.

**Notes:**

\[1\] Thank you in advance, Dan!

\[2\] Still an office. I know I'm lucky.

\[3\] This is a phrase I grew up with. Since moving, I have learned not everyone knows about [wheelhouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelhouse_\(archaeology\)) or [slang based upon them.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_\(W\))
