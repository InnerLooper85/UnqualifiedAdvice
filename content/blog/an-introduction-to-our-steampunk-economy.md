One day you’ll be watching yourself in the mirror as you brush your teeth. Staring deeply into your own reflection – oh, those piercing eyes! – you’ll mutter to yourself, specks of toothpaste flying toward the mirror, “My first day of college was twenty years ago.”

Then, your wife will walk in and say, “What the F\*ck, Sean. I just cleaned that mirror!”

That was me this August.

Twenty years ago, I started earning my degree in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. I came in with an interest in physics and an awkward air. After five years and a solid 10,000 hours of studying, that interest in physics grew into a love. It only took another 3,000 hours of bartending to help get rid of the awkwardness.

My favorite class was thermodynamics, where we learned all about the different ways energy is transformed. In an internal combustion engine, we transform chemical energy (gasoline) into kinetic energy (motion). In an air conditioner, we transform electrical energy into the ability to sleep through an August night in Houston.

In all those years since, I’ve refined my understanding of thermodynamic systems. Seventeen years after starting at Purdue, I went back to school for an MBA. My years of working unearthed an interest in business. I wanted to learn finance!

So, I did the damned thing and went back to study finance. I thought I was in for all-new territory. To my surprise, it turned out to be complementary! Sure, it seemed new on the surface. But It was really just learning about a new type of energy. _Economic energy_.

While learning to read balance sheets and create economic forecasts, I had an epiphany. Our economy is a giant steampunk electricity plant running a very unusual [Rankine power cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_cycle). 

In a power plant, water is boiled to make steam. That steam goes through a turbine which spins magnets around a coil of copper wire. Those spinning magnets induce an alternating electric current in the copper wire. The current exits the wires and powers our world. The steam exiting the turbine has given up most of its energy and becomes water again. 

**The Chemistry of our Economic Steam**

In our economy, money is turned into all sorts of things and back into money again. These transactions spin the turbines that generate the power within our economy.

What’s my view? In engineering terms, money is actually a liquid. And that’s why _**all this**_ – I’m waving my hands around, trying to point to all of society – actually works. 

Let’s get nerdy. 

A classical definition of liquid is something that is smooth and unconstrained in movement, meaning it will take the shape of whatever is holding it. Also, it has a constant volume. The constant volume part is what makes it different from a gas, like steam. You can take steam and squeeze it into a smaller vessel. A liquid, like a solid, can’t be squeezed into a smaller shape.

This means that _volume_ in the engineering sense translates most accurately to _value_ in a financial sense. If you make this substitution, the rest of the definition lines up quite nicely.

_It flows freely._ Look at these two dapper gentlemen, just having a blast, passing it back and forth.

_It takes the shape of whatever is holding it._ Here are a some different vessels containing various values of money.

_And it has a constant value._ Though other things do get more expensive.

Now, as I said, money is not only a liquid but is A LOT like water. Living things need to consume and process water every day to survive. Our economy needs to consume and process money to survive. Like water shapes the mountains we gaze upon, money shapes the institutions we thrive within.

In our lives, we end up having a lot of money going in and out of our possession. And we tend to want to grow the amount of money we’re holding onto. We need a tool to help us keep track of it all. It doesn’t have to be anything complicated. A simple savings account will do. If you think about your money being liquid, you might imagine your savings account looking like this:

You can easily put money in. You can see how much you have... You can pour measured amounts out with care. You can turn it over and empty it all at once. Yep, definitely what a savings account looks like.

We want to start filling our savings account with liquid. Our savings accounts may have one or many streams that fill them up. Maybe you have a nine-to-five as a dental hygienist and get a regular paycheck every 2 weeks. Maybe you spend your nights between classes bartending, hoping to catch a good shift. 

_Or… lean in close now… I’m whispering this part. Maybe you’ve been employed as an engineer for two decades and are starting a series of side hustles to change your career path._ 

Regardless, the aim over time is to fill the beaker with liquid.

Obviously, life is not only income. If it were, money really wouldn’t do any good anyway. We also have expenses that we use that money on. When I turned 16, I got my first job taking care of kids after school. Once I began earning the most difficult $5.50 an hour I would ever make, I started to have to pay to put gas in the 1987 Chevy Nova \[1\] I used to get from point A to B.

To our beaker, gaining a repeating expense is like putting a hole in its side. A tiny hole, like my gas payments, will only let out a drip. Larger holes, like a monthly car payment or rent, will let out more of a steady stream.

As long as the collective streams going out (expenses) are smaller than the streams coming in (income), the beaker will continue to fill. Many of us will spend a better portion of our lifetime trying to grow the volume of the liquid in our personal beaker. We hope to be able to get it so full that we can stop filling it and just live off the contents.

I would guess that if you are reading this, you probably have that goal yourself. We can get there quicker by unlocking some more advanced properties of money. As I mentioned, liquid money has a property of having a constant value. If I have a dollar in an account today it will still be worth a dollar tomorrow. No more, no less. 

But, liquids aren’t always liquid. We use economic physics to turn our liquid money into a solid (ice) and a gas (steam) to unlock new possibilities.

Remember how I said the economy was like a steampunk power plant?

The environment in this power plant is very humid. In our steampunk economy, there are lots of leaky valves and the occasional burst pipe that let out a lot of free-floating energy in the form of steam. 

Steam is just really hot water. Ultimately, we’re trying to get more water into our beaker. So, how do we use this steamy, chaotic environment to achieve our goal? 

Check back soon and I’ll introduce you to a few of my favorite tools.
