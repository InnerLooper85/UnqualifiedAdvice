Last time I talked about my feelings of [the review process in Corporate Life™](https://blacktuesdays.substack.com/p/i-bought-us-a-dragon-to-lighten-the). In short, I don't like it. I've been trying to put my finger on how to describe why I don't like it.

My theory: Employee reviews suffer from what I'm dubbing the Hallmark Card Effect. At first, I wanted to call it the Valentine's Day Effect, but [that seemed](https://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/valentines-day-love-state-mind) to [have been](https://www.forbes.com/2006/02/10/divorce-valentine-marriage-cx_kdt_0213divorce.html?sh=52e058367fbc) well [spoken for](https://blogs.cofc.edu/hss/2015/02/06/the-valentines-day-effect/). So I thought about it some more. I think The Hallmark Card effect is better.

> Me: I'm getting, there! You're always so impatient, imaginary reader!

Imagine the occasions that you receive a card made by Hallmark.

Valentine's, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Boss's Day, Administrative Assistant's day. Et cetera.

In my own _personal experience_ getting an annual evaluation feels a lot like receiving a Hallmark Card. Both are something that someone is somehow _obliged_ to give you, once a year, that they should be giving you every day. In the case of the cards, it's attention and admiration. In the case of the reviews, it's useful feedback.

The best bosses, in my mind, don't need to give a quarterly/semi-annual/annual reviews. Their employees already know where they're excelling and falling behind. We have periodic reviews, whatever the frequency may be, because managers generally suck at this. Kind of like why we have Valentine’s Day, because one half-of-the-relationship often forgets how important praise is to the other-half.

I told you about my experience last year, sharing a personal SWOT with my team. This year, I tried another form of honesty with my team. I told them about my philosophy on feedback.

**Manager’s Log**

**or: What I see**

Hello team,

I am reaching out to do something a bit new. This week, we had a training for our manufacturing leadership. We talked about the importance and art of giving feedback.

One of my biggest complaints I have had in my career with SLB revolves around the feedback I have received. I KNOW I am not perfect. I KNOW there are times that I could do better.

Unfortunately, oftentimes nobody told me that I erred until too late. This has happened to me more than once. Each time it happened, I felt left high-and-dry \[1\]. None of those experiences were "good". In hindsight, though, they did cause me to grow.

Once an error has reared its head, I find myself doing the worst thing possible. I internalize it. I blame myself for things that were not in my control. At best, this makes me hesitant to try again. At worst, this makes me feel like nothing is in my control and I stop trying to influence the things that I am able to. This is my own damage. I know that had any of you been in my shoes, you would have experienced it differently.

Why do managers often suck at feedback?

We like you. We really, really like you!

In July, I will hit the ominous milestone of 13 years with SLB. I have not loved parts of it. But, I am still here and I'm happy that I am! The best part of my job is you.  Seeing your growth as a team brings me more happiness and satisfaction than I have ever known. Each of you are becoming experts in areas where I am only a tourist. As you gain expertise, you surpass me.

My goal as a manager, or at least what I think my goal should be, is to grow and elevate as many people as I can. You all impress me in ways that I do not expect. You do it every day.

Us managers see you growing. Sometimes you grow in our pre-defined paths. Sometimes you grow outside the lines. The outside-the-line growth is what we crave. When you grow outside the lines of our imagination, it means you are taking ownership.

Take more ownership.

I've said a lot, without ever addressing the point.... why do managers suck at feedback?

Well, I don't know.

That must feel like an unsatisfying answer. At least it is honest. It does lead to another question.

What can I do to fix this?

It's so simple that I'm sorry I didn't see it before.

I can make one simple promise. My door is open. If you ever feel the need for feedback, come ask for it. Within one day, I commit to providing you two things:

1.     An area and specific example of where, I think, you are killing it.

2.     An area and specific example of where I have not been blown-away by your excellence.

I am not going to say that you are bad at that thing. You are doing things that I am not. There are difficulties you will experience that will not get translated to me. My intent in the feedback will be to highlight how you can get stronger.

My door and inbox are open as tools for you to grow. I truly hope you use them.

**How Has it Worked?**

Stupendously.

The amount of ownership I have seen my team grab at since receiving this was a definite step-change. Things that used to hit-my-plate are intercepted before they arrive. Things that are on-my-plate have been digested with greater rapidity.

What’s more impressive, is that things I had imagined in my brain, but never said, have started to appear before my eyes. My takeaway: when given permission, people want to and will excel beyond your expectations.

Give them more permission.

**The Magic of Permission**

I know an owner of a small business \[2\]. He refers to it as a HoldCo, short for [Holding Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company). In basic terms, this means he owns one company and that company owns other companies. [John D. Rockefeller](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/standard-oil-part-i) started this [type of arrangement](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/standard-oil-part-ii).

This small business (he would say SMB) owner looked longingly at Bill Gate's famous [Think Weeks](https://hbr.org/2017/09/how-to-rediscover-your-inspiration-at-work). He imagined being able to step back fully from his day to day to let his mind wander, unwind, explore and, ultimately, strategize in the benefit of his businesses and his teams. 

Here’s the rub. Running this kind of small organization, you can feel wholly responsible for EVERYTHING. When you’re responsible for it all, how are you supposed to step away? 

From his account, he had a great team, but he was still so tightly involved that vacations involved phone calls, meetings, etc. He never really was off the clock, so Think Week seemed impossible. 

Until… he did it. He went totally offline for one week. Guess what happened?!?! His team, the one he helped build, rose to the occasion. 

Now his team feels more empowered and independent. And so does he. He’s seen their ability to solve their own problems. More importantly, so have they. He came back refreshed (the braggart!) and full of new ideas. I think returned to a team that had undergone a step change. 

They were given permission. 

It was a different setup or mechanism of permission. But I find this example enlightening because: 1, it's real. 2, it is further proof that you, too, may be sitting on a great opportunity to give it to yourself and to your team. Do it with less worry. Just tell them. They will appreciate you for it.

We all might be surprised what we get when we trust, empower, and shepherd. 

**Thank You!**

Hey, you! Yes, you, the one reading this. Thanks for spending your life minutes with me. My last post about Getting SWOTty just crossed 350 views. When I started putting skin-to-plastic to type out words for you to read, I never thought that there would be so many “yous” that would read.

If you like the things that come out of my brain, it means the world to me if you share, subscribe to, or like my posts.

Y'all rock!

**Side Notes**

\[1\] To be fair, the managers that made me feel this way are no longer with the company.

\[2\] Thank you for sharing your story… you know who you are.
