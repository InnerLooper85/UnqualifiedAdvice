Since I began this newsletter, it has been something that has brought me joy. But... damn! I hit this block. I found myself unable to form a thought that I found worth writing about for months-on-end. It was a bummer.

I wanted to write. I love to do it. I hope you like to read it!? But I… just.. couldn’t do it.

Last year, I shared about the experience of [losing my dad](https://blacktuesdays.substack.com/p/time-heals-all-wounds). That was August 2022. In June 2023, we held his memorial. I wanted to speak at it. Everyone in my locus of love was quick to inform me that I didn't _have_ to. They were right.

However.

_I wanted to._

I am glad I did.

I’m not the first, nor will be the last, to lose a parent. Whenever you are on your personal timeline, this is for you, when the time is right.

**What I Tried to Say**

A lot of the interests in my life came from experiences with my dad. I’d guess that’s a bit true for all of us, with our parents.

One thing I know I got from him is my love of radio. We used to stay up late to listen to Coast to Coast AM. Art Bell, the enigmatic host, brought in guests to talk about the paranormal and “opened-up-the-lines” to all the night-owls. Never have I been so sure in my sanity as some of those nights.

Dad also introduced me to NPR. On my weekends with him, we’d tune in to hear Click and Clack diagnose car problems or Garrison Keillor share his whimsical tales from Lake Woebegone.

One day, some years ago, I was listening to a Writer’s Almanac episode, a daily installment that always ended with Keillor reading a poem. I’d like to read one of those that stuck with me here today.

I am sorry I don’t have his oratorial skills or deep baritone, but I hope you find something in it, nonetheless.

> 
> their brookless and forestless yards,

> 
> helpless to do anything to help him, certain he was beyond
> 
> any aid, any desire to save him, and he ran loping on,
> 
> far out of his element, sick, panting, starving,
> 
> his eyes fixed on some point ahead of him,
> 
> some possible salvation
> 
> in all this hopelessness, that only he could see.

Later in life, my love of radio turned into a love of podcasts. One of those podcasts, a silly but [lovely little show](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/) about [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) inspired me to get this tattoo here on my arm.

This show, the Adventure Zone, was started by three brothers and their father. The brothers had moved away from their hometown in West Virginia. Their mother had recently passed from cancer. They wanted to stay connected. So, they turned their pain into creativity. And… they recorded this beautiful thing and shared it with the world.

Throughout the show, the youngest brother acts as the dungeon master, the one responsible for setting the scene for the others to interact with. Through the span of three years of recording, he artfully weaved in themes of mourning and loss and of love and of community.

Towards the culmination of the story, the youngest son, acting as protagonists’ main tormentor, comes to his father’s character with a question. He asks:

> “Merle, you’ve had it so rough. I’ve made sure of that! You’ve lost so much, but you keep trying. You keep coming here to talk to me and… I gotta know… how do you do it?”

I don’t know, but I don’t believe they were talking about a game in that moment. The answer struck me so deeply, that I got Merle Highchurch’s words written indelibly on my arm:

It is advice I try to live by every day.

My dad brought a lot a people joy throughout his life. The times I remember bringing us the most joy together centered around a wooden floor measuring 50’ x 94’, with two iron hoops on either end.

For us, [Butler Basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men%27s_basketball) was the ultimate way to spend time together. We took pilgrimages watch them in March that took us to Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland and Birmingham.

We saw some fun moments, like Darnell Archey setting a record for consecutive free throws made. We were there watching the team make the Sweet 16, as they upset Louisville.

We saw some heartbreak, too. We saw the team team suffering their own upset in the Horizon League tournament. Butler was eliminated before the tourney even began. Our loss was nothing. In the days leading up to the game, one of the team's stars had lost his mother.

The 2010 Final Four in Indy brought us to our zenith. Attending the Final Four to watch Butler with my dad was a dream come true. We jumped with joy and hugged and high-fived as the bulldogs defeated Michigan State. They had played their way into a matchup against Duke.

The final game was a rush of adrenaline and close the whole way.

I only remember one play.

I remember the joy and excitement of my dad and I clutching each other’s hands when, down 2, Gordon Hayward released a shot from half court. I remember the feeling of seeing the shot be on line… the breathless moment as we waited \[1\].

I remember the smile on my dad’s face when I turned to him, and he said:

> Damn, that was close. We almost had them!

**Heavy Lifting**

I thought about those words for 10 months. I wrote and re-wrote them countless times. Many people only have a couple of days to get their words together. I’m not sure which is better.

The last “final-final-FINAL\_draft.docx” was scrapped at 2:00 AM, the night before, for the words above.

They were the hardest words I have ever spoken. Speaking them was worth every bit of effort. It may have not been what everyone needs in that situation, but it’s what I needed.

I miss my dad. He was not perfect, but he helped make me who I am. He was always a bit of a ham, so I don’t think he’d mind me sharing this with you. I believe he’d feel honored.
