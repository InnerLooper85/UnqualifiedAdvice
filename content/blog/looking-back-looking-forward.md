Hello dear Reader,

This month I sent out Fig Social Capital’s first _Quarterly Report_ to our clients. You can read my letter to them below! Every three months, I will be writing about the market and how I am approaching the current landscape, as it pertains to my duties as Chief Everything Officer (still just CEO, nobody needs new acronyms) of Fig Social Capital, LLC.

All clients of Fig will be getting this letter with their quarterly account statement. Here’s the thing: I want to share this writing with a broader audience. But! I find it unfair to my paying clients to give this away for free.

I mean, they are literally paying me for a combination of insight and action. If I give away the insight, then they are only paying me for action. My clients tend to be pretty action oriented. They don’t need me for action.

Also, my time is worth something. I am proud of that.

So.

### Pay up!

I am introducing a couple of paid subscription options to augment _Goodbye Black Tuesdays_, which will remain free and (I hope to) publish monthly. If you are already subscribed to the free newsletter, nothing will change for you and you don’t need to do a damned thing.

_If_ you are interested in some specific topics, or want to show some love, I will be eternally grateful if you subscribe to one of the options below.

##### Option 1: _The Founder’s Log_

Have you ever thought of starting a company and want to read about my screw-ups? Do you like my writing and want to buy me a beer or cup of coffee once-in-a-while? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, this option is for you.

Every month, subscribers to _The Founder’s Log_ will receive a missive on the challenges I have faced in starting and running my business. Also, all _Founder’s Log_ subscribers will receive the Fig Quarterly Letter one quarter (3 months) after it’s original publication to Fig’s clients.

_Cost: $5/month (paid monthly) or $50/year (paid annually)_

##### Option 2: _Fig Enthusiast_

Do you really dig my jam? Sign up to be a _Fig Enthusiast_ and get all the benefits of _Founder’s Log_ subscribers plus the Fig Quarterly Letter two-weeks after Fig Social Capital’s clients.

_Cost: Suggested $240 (paid annually), but kind of up to you. Again, a wide audience is my jam._

#### What are you gonna do with all those newsletter dollars, Mr. CEO?

That’s a good question! I’m glad you asked. Attentive and longtime readers may recall my mention of Fig’s bigger goals, in an earlier post. You could check it, [if you want to](https://blacktuesdays.substack.com/p/life-imitates-life).

In that post, I mentioned a venture expanding into financial literacy education, Pareto’s Alpha. You subscription dollars will go directly to fund this venture! We have begun work with our first contract-employee, a bright student at the University of Chicago. Here roots lie in Houston’s, where one of her teachers first introduced us.

We have big goals over at Pareto’s Alpha and paying Yarselyn justly is chief among them. Help us do that with your support here.

### A Little Further Ado

As of this writing, _Goodbye Black Tuesdays_ is a few subscribers shy of 50. Thank all of you for your support! It has been a big lift to me over the last year and has driven me to continue writing.

As a thanks, anyone who is already subscribes or subscribes to the free _Goodbye Black Tuesdays_ will get an offer for three-free months as a _Fig Enthusiast_. Thank you for the time you’ve spent reading my words.

This one is on the house.

Enjoy.

Goodbye Black Tuesdays is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

# The Quarterly Letter

At the end of 2021, when I launched Fig, I was thinking about this letter and what it would be like to write it. There were strong indicators a financial bloodletting was coming, and there I was starting an investment advisory business in a bad market. I wasn’t sure at all what tone this first letter would have to take, but my worst fears were avoided.

It may seem counterintuitive, but I knew 2021 was the right time to launch my firm. It was going to be a chaotic year and chaos breeds opportunity. In my conversations with all of you over the last year, one common question I heard was, “_what the heck is going on?”_ I’m paraphrasing here, because some of you most definitely did not say heck. You know who you are.

And for that, and more: Thank you. Thank you for the honor of your business, the trust you put in me, and the occasionally colorful candor in our exchanges. Without you, there would be no need to write this report, and that would be a shame because I’m enjoying putting it together.

But let’s rewind, slightly. What the heck IS going on? And why start an investment advisory business in a bad market?

## Macro Trends

I think to understand what happened in investment markets in 2022, it’s helpful to start with a look at the Macro environment. At the end of 2021, inflation had started to really take off. It was apparent the Federal Reserve would _finally_ start stepping up interest rates. This alone meant trouble for both equity and bond markets.

The Fed had lowered the Federal Funds Rate to 0% in response to the pandemic. This rate drives all other interest rates in the economy on some level, most importantly the rates on treasuries. It’s also the Fed’s main tool in fighting inflation. When inflation is high, the Fed will use interest rates to combat it. Here’s a graph to provide some historical context.

The years following the Great Financial Crisis saw historically low interest rates in a Zero Interest Rate Policy regime. This policy was enacted to spur economic growth and recovery, following the destruction of the crisis. Some companies made great use of this time, using access to low-cost debt to fund growth projects. If you were invested in FAANG stocks and tech indices, you experienced great returns for the 2010s.  

As the economy began to finally normalize and inflation looked to rise above their 2% target, the Fed was able to begin raising rates. They did it very slowly.

In December 2015, the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf) (FOMC) decided to raise the target federal funds rate range to 0.25% to 0.50%. This 0.25% hike – you may hear people on CNBC say 25 basis point – was the first federal funds rate hike since [June 2006](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20060629a.htm). The results of this hike were as expected and a second hike wouldn’t come until [December 2016](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20161214a1.pdf). In all, the Fed gradually increased rates, 0.25% at a time, until the federal funds rate peaked with a target range of 2.25% to 2.50% after the [December 2018](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20181219a1.pdf) FOMC meeting.

That slow increase of rates kept impacts in equity and bond markets muted, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 maintaining upward growth until September of 2018, when markets finally turned bearish leading both indices to finish the year in the red.

Let’s look at our current trend of increasing rates. 2022 saw hikes in [March](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220316a1.pdf) (0.25%), [May](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220504a1.pdf) (0.5%), [June](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220615a1.pdf) (0.75%), [July](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220727a1.pdf) (0.75%), [September](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220921a1.pdf) (0.75%), [November](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20221102a1.pdf) (0.75%), and [December](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20221214a1.pdf) (0.5%), taking the target rate from 0.00% to 0.25% at the start of the year to 4.25% to 4.50%. These aggressive increases, while absolutely necessary to fight inflation, have side effects on markets.

At the beginning of the year, investors couldn’t earn much by holding onto cash. Hell, for much of the last decade that’s been the case. Let me show you.

[

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0a61013-7b48-410d-b432-72c80eec2bd4_936x432.png)

As the federal funds rate goes, so goes treasury yields (generally). In the zero interest rate timeframes, it was hard to find an option for keeping cash that yielded more than a percent or two, which drives up interest (and prices) in equities (stocks). Today, there are a variety options for investors to earn 4% yield on short-term cash savings. This means stocks have to generate more returns for investors, when factoring in relative risks, and prices have resultingly fallen.

This rate change has also hurt bond holders. As rates rise, bonds that were purchased at lower rates become less attractive and their market values are driven down. Why? Pretend I bought a $1,000 bond paying 2% interest last year. That means every six-months I get a check for $10, a total of $20 every year. When the bond matures, I get my original $1,000 back. I could keep the bond until maturity, or sell it if I felt there was a better use of the money. However, I may not be able to sell it for the face value (called the par value) of the bond. If someone could go buy a new bond today giving them 4% interest, so $40 on every $1,000 each year, why would they pay $1,000 for one that only pays $20? So if I do sell, I have to sell at a discount. This discounting of bonds is what many investors saw las year.

Investors with exposure to bonds, experienced the worst year on record for US bond performance in 2022. 2023 promises to bring additional discounting to bond holdings, as rates are expected to continue their climb. However, as we reach what may be peak rates, we are now in a period where buying bonds has become attractive. If you buy bonds when rates are high, then the market value of them will increase if the Fed drops rates.

Another point of interest from this chart is the _yield curve_ is inverted. Normally, the longer you lend someone money, the more interest rate you can charge. This is because additional time means additional risk. Currently, you can make MORE on short term loans to the US Government than long term ones. Here’s the curve today versus 2018.

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36fcf6b1-1962-47f2-8560-fb914b5f1b29_720x440.png)

The line from 2018 is going up and to the right, which is healthy. Today, it’s going down to the right… not healthy. There’s still a lot of unease and shifting going on in public markets. As interest rates continue to change, so will valuations of stocks and bonds on the secondary markets. I don’t expect the pain we felt in 2022 is fully over. I will continue to recommend outsizing cash positions in portfolios for the near term.

## Micro Impacts

Aside from causing overall valuations to change on a macro level, rates are going to start creating micro economic (think more company/security specific) impacts. As the cost of obtaining new debt goes up, companies are going to have to evaluate their future budgets and product plans. Hiding poor management, lack of strategy, and financial weakness will be much tougher for companies in the coming years. We’re seeing the beginnings of this with the recent waves of tech layoffs.

With the ability to gain a meaningful return on cash holdings, generating real returns will be more important for companies in the 2020s than it was in the 2010s. The ability for a company to generate and grow free cash flow will be tested. Companies that can manage their balance sheets and inventories to thrive in higher rate environments will have the edge over companies seeking growth-for-growth’s sake. Those with the strongest ability to generate cash will have the most opportunities at consolidating market share through the ability to provide better service. I expect 2023 to be a year where organizations who have grown through excessive borrowing will struggle and become targets for acquisition by more resilient competitors.  

Companies in most industries have found it necessary to be very mindful of inflating input costs. In some instances, companies are in industries with pricing power and have the ability to pass along these costs. Fig looks for companies that are able to effectively mitigate inflation impacts or prevent margin erosion with pricing power.

## Themes for the New Year

It’s strange how different January can feel from December. That roll over in the calendar year has the ability to hit the reset button on people’s mindset. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up on the year, continuing the climb they’ve been on for the last three months. But to repeat myself, I do not think we’ve seen the end of the pain we felt in 2022. From the statements from Chairman Powell and Governors Lael Brainard and Susan Collins, the Fed will hike again in February and ultimately aim to get the fund rate over 5.00%. How close will they get in February? I don’t know, though it seems likely to be a 0.25% hike. Recent CPI reports show year-over-year inflation has started to decline. In my opinion, inflation won’t track a straight downward slope. We’ll see some downward movement, some upward movement, etc. Few things are linear because impacts from rate changes will take time to flush through the system, and contracts expire at different times. Also, deglobalization trends promise to be inflationary, so we may be in for years of inflation over the Fed’s stated 2% target. Despite persistent inflationary effects, I expect a gentler Fed this year.

Throughout most of last year, my level of unease was very high. I’m still uneasy about mid-term prospects. We’ve seen much of the needed compression of values that were inflated from pandemic recovery spending. As we move another year away from March of 2020, investment markets now seem to be past the worst of their pandemic hangover. What does all this mean for where I’m looking for opportunity in 2023?

### Atoms & Molecules

There is significant societal and political will to move towards a “decarbonized” world. Title V of [Public Law 116-169](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ169/PLAW-117publ169.pdf) is full of funding for clean energy, almost $400 billion in total, with the energy sector ($250 billion) and manufacturing ($47 billion) getting the largest allocations. More of the world is buying electric vehicles (EVs) than ever before. According to one [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evs-made-up-10-of-all-new-cars-sold-last-year-11673818385) from the Wall Street Journal, EV demand made up more than 10% of total global vehicle demand, with the US (5.8%) lagging behind Europe (11%) and China (21%). As this transition continues, the global material supply mix will see some interesting changes.

First off, we are still a LONG way from the day when we stop burning hydrocarbons to power all of our transportation needs, let alone power generation. Oil is still the dominant source of the energy that is powering the device you are reading this on. Demand for jet fuel is expected to grow substantially year-over-year, as China continues their reopening. After the balance sheet fires and project culling many O&G companies saw in 2020, they are finding themselves favorably positioned for another strong year, after a year where energy was the only bright spot in the markets. Opportunities within the O&G supply chain are likely to remain a strong focus in 2023.

Secondly, we are going to see a shift in how we use our elements. The EV market is certainly growing! This means there is going to be a change in the \*stuff\* that the finished products we buy are made from. The average EV uses far more copper than a traditional vehicle. Why? They are driven by electric motors that rely on lots of copper wire. On the commodity level, copper prices could see upward pressure from steady demand growth. On the processing level, mining projects and companies benefit from being able to better predict cashflows than, say, Netflix. They sell a portion of their supply through more stable long-term contracts. They can take advantage of pricing spikes through spot sales and futures hedging. The downside is the known finiteness of the resource. A copper deposit, once depleted, is gone. And if there is no supply coming in to back it up, then prices will adjust accordingly. Netflix could see no demand, reduce prices and sell us all more views of the same shows we’ve already seen. See the difference?

There are strong reasons to invest across the raw materials supply chain. Many will argue to look at the end elements being produced and chase pricing through futures, but the problem is those go poof in an instant. If you own the companies that produce the elements, you are much more resilient.

### Tech… Maybe

I don’t feel like the way we classify tech companies is useful. Some tech companies are pure software. Some produce physical goods. Sone exist somewhere further up the supply chain.  The biggest benefit of a “tech” company is derived from what is known as the network-effect and – in the case of software of media – very low incremental-unit-costs.

The problem, historically, with tech companies is their ability to grow because the way they’ve grown has been quite unpredictable. A copper mine has a certain amount of copper available in the mine. It is limited. A company that can sell you copies that cost nothing to produce have a different set of economics.

That said, I still favor the companies in the tech space that produce physical products. Why? They are less disruptable. I can imagine someone designing a new software that makes another software obsolete (Microsoft may be the exception here). I cannot imagine a way that ASML lithography technology loses value overnight.  

So, if I can imagine one software company losing value overnight, that means I can imagine another company gaining value overnight. These exist. The problem is, today (January 2023), unless you have specific experience (are an insider) in the end use market, it’s very cloudy who has any distinct advantage.

### Debt

It’s been a long time since owning debt has been as appealing as it is becoming. Short term treasuries are yielding close to 5%. This may seem high to many investors today, after a decade of low rates being engrained in our minds. I suggest you look back at the historical chart of interest rates, because even today’s rates are below most anything pre-2000. We are still at historically low rates. Anything short of a severe and sharp recession is unlikely to drive the Fed to meaningfully reduce rates or ease monetary policy.

The dynamics in the debt markets are set up for corporate bonds (investment grade and high yield) and treasuries to become a more meaningful part of investors’ portfolios than they have been in a decade. These changing dynamics are likely harkening a new season in the market. This new season will enable different strategies to be employed, allowing investors more options to achieve the returns they desire.

### Vices & Escapes & Self-Improvement

I am somewhere between _still growing up_ and my twentieth year of being an adult, depending upon your measure. It’s hard business, being an adult. And that’s why companies exist to fill markets in what I call the vice-escape-self-improvement continuum. Here’s how I visualize that continuum:

Sectors that bridge overlap different areas of the continuum, represent interesting areas for opportunity. To me, these are sectors that are more resilient to macro-factors. I am actively looking for good companies in these sectors.

## In Closing

I’m looking forward to working for you this year—and hearing every possible version of “what the \_\_\_” again. At the beginning of 2022, I had an idea, a registered LLC and a plan. As of this writing, that has evolved into having real clients (nine of you!) and about $200K under management.

Thank you for giving me a chance. Each of you have a unique risk profile. As such, your returns vary. But I am proud to say that each of you are up. I will detail your individual portfolio performance in later sections. Thank you for your trust and imagination.

To temper any expectations for 2023, I will leave you with one final thought from one of the greatest philosophers of the last century.
