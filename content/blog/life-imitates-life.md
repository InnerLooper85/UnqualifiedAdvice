## **#CorporateLife**

Those in-the-know are aware that I have spent the last dozen years or so working for Schlumberger.

That is no longer true.

I now work for [SLB](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-giant-schlumberger-rebrands-itself-slb-low-carbon-future-2022-10-24/).

Living through a corporate rebrand from the inside has been fascinating. To see the effort required to get 100,000+ people to pivot is incredible. In my last post I announced a rebrand of this newsletter. Only having to get myself inline is much easier. I'm just happy I beat SLB to the punch. But why rebrand this publication, still in its infancy?

For one, I’d guess few of you recall the original name. No better time for a change to a brand than before you have one established. Second, much like SLB, I'm trying to align my brand with aspects of where I want my company to go in the future. I was unsure of my end vision when I started “Thoughts on the Value Stream” – bonus points to anyone that knew the original name. Now I have a much better idea of what I want to do. The vision for Fig revolves around three elements. These elements are spokes on the flywheel that will enable Fig Social Capital to grow and progress our \[1\] vision:

Our advisement services create the network and revenue needed to for Fig to help others launch small businesses. The small businesses will generate new potential investors, through their owners and employees. Our educational support services will help create new investors and entrepreneurs.

Where does “Goodbye, Black Tuesdays” fall into this? It fits into the category I am most passionate about: education. My friend [Dan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhatke/) and I have recently been working on a platform we are calling Pareto's Alpha \[2\]. We aim to make knowledge, that we had to get MBAs to learn, available to anyone with curiosity and a web-browser. Pareto’s Alpha is distinctly under the financial education spoke of the flywheel.  Most important, it is a way of giving back to the world.  

We are beginning to work on the platform design and content structure now. We have a broad plan, and the scope of work is daunting. There is no shortage of people telling others what to do with their money on The Internet. We will pair important concepts with relatable stories to help others apply the concepts directly to their own lives.

In the future, we plan to start a venture supporting financial education for school-aged learners. Our goal: give parents ideas on how to teach basic money concepts to their short ones. Dan and I strongly believe that good money habits start young. Unfortunately, money is a taboo subject for some and many more lack ideas on how to educate their children on the subject.

Whether I am helping others 1-to-1 in a Fig client setting, or 1-to-many with Pareto’s Alpha, I am striking at the same goal. I like that alignment.

“Goodbye, Black Tuesdays” will be an Op-Ed and my personal outlet. Welcome to the ground floor everyone! The site doesn't even exist and you are already getting content. My hope with our work on Pareto's Alpha is to build something special and to demonstrate credibility and legitimacy for my work with Fig.

Speaking of credibility...

_**note: this section is written for future publication by Fig Social Capital and shared here for your feedback.**_

Hello,

My name is Sean. I am the founder of Fig Social Capital. Thank you for spending your life-minutes on our website. I hope reading about Fig makes it worth-your-while.

If you are here, you are likely considering if Fig is right for you. Let me help you work through that question.

As of today, a nice fall evening in 2022, Fig Social Capital has one employee. That employee is me, Sean Filipow. When you agree to work with my company, you are agreeing to work with me. Why should you want to work with me?

I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and started my career just before the Great Financial Crisis. My first engineering job was in automotive. To be precise, I worked in the design and manufacturing of specialty seals. This was my first job in [rubber](https://blacktuesdays.substack.com/p/everything-is-a-bead)! Sometimes, I miss the smell of Hyrdrogenated Nitrile Butadine Rubber in the morning.

After seeing the writing on the walls of the closing auto plants, I decided to branch out. I left the home comforts of Indiana \[3\] and made my way to Houston, Texas. Since the move, my career has put me at the forefront of production and operations in the energy industry. This is a double-edged sword. Working in the energy industry means living in the energy cycle.

It is a brutal cycle.

I've survived five rounds of layoffs in my 15 years in the industry. It feels good to still be standing, but the journey has taken a toll. However, with difficulty comes opportunity. I cannot imagine having accomplished what I have without facing challenges.

Here is a list of some of my favorite memories:

-   Climbed up the outside of an 800' distillation column. Then climbed back down through the inside, looking at the condition of the steel within.  
    
-   Worked night shift through maintenance-cycles to support on-the-fly decision making.
    
-   Created Excel files with enough lines of data to the limits of the software.
    
-   Applied for [two patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Sean+Filipow&oq=Sean+Filipow), had one granted.

-   Spent months living in hotels, traveling through dozens of states, observing product performance on location. 
    
-   Tore my Achilles while dancing with my wife in our kitchen and changed my life.
    
-   Mentored some amazing engineers. 
    

After reading that list, I imagine you and I having the following conversation:

> **You:** Why would any of that qualify you for managing _my money_?
> 
> **Me:** My past has taught me all about complex systems from the small details up to the big picture results.
> 
> Do I know everything about refining because I spent days climbing through distillation towers and tanks? No.
> 
> Do I know all there is to about drilling and fracking from countless hours visiting well sites? No.
> 
> Do I fully comprehend energy because I studied the fundamentals of how it flows? Not likely.
> 
> But combined, all these experiences help me understand systems and flows. I have a knack for seeing interrelations and interconnections. I get how a delay from a company like 3M can lead to a company like Boeing not being able to fulfill their demand.
> 
> I admit, I know very little. However, I think I have an advantage in seeing things others do not.
> 
> **You:** eh... maybe ? How does your Achilles play into it?
> 
> **Me:** Tearing my achilles gave me three months to take stock. I had surgery on Halloween in 2018 and spent the rest of the year recovering. It was the first time in two decades I had a break longer than a week. I spent the time reflecting on my career, my knowledge, and my dreams. I realized that if you were to make a Venn diagram of the three, it would look something like the outline of a cartoon mouse.

> My career and my knowledge overlapped. My knowledge and my dreams overlapped. But my career and my dreams were separate. Maybe Mickey had the same problem?

After having this realization, I knew I needed a realignment. Eventually, I got my butt in gear and started the MBA journey. Once on the MBA path, I learned how my past experiences contained more value than I knew.

The "math" I was taught to become an investment professional was, frankly, a watered-down and poorly understood version \[4\] of what I learned in engineering school. The moral of the story on understanding the value of a company was to "know how the business operates." I have spent the better part of two decades learning how businesses operate in boom-and-bust cycles.

Now, I am working to enter a new world with Fig Social Capital. A world I have found full of people who don't understand the math and have limited experience running a business. I know the math. I have seen how a business is operated at a managerial level. I have a leg up here. I’ll leave wire instructions below.

**Why Fig Social Capital?**

**or: What Makes you Different?**

There are many problems with wealth management today. I am launching Fig, a registered investment advisory firm, to address those that I can.

At the most basic level, I hope everyone can save something for the future. What people are able to save, I want to help is employ for the betterment of their lives. How? By helping everyone better understand the systems we have, why they are important, and how they can be useful to everyone in society.

I think my hopes are not, by-in-large, being achieved. We have an amazing mechanism for the creation of stability in our country, but we are doing a shit-job of educating people on how to use it.

As I see it, here is where Fig can make an impact:

> 1\.  Portfolios and plans must be built with needs of the individual in mind. Today, people are ushered into one-size-fits-all passive approaches. These approaches are easy to manage and sell but ignore the individuality of each situation.
> 
> 2\.  Risk management, as defined by current industry standards, is inadequate. The math is wrong. In developing more personal profiles for our clients, we will be mindful of how our clients are exposed to risk in meaningful ways.
> 
> 3\.  Investing needs to be a net benefit to our society. Many see the current system as selectively extracting value, rather than adding. Many see the current system as only working for people that have substantial wealth. I hope my work through Fig can change this viewpoint by empowering more people.

Am I being overconfident in what Fig can achieve? I do not truly know. But I'm ready to go to work to answer that question. I hope you decide to join me on this journey.

#### Notes:

\[1\] I am using the _Royal Our_ here. If I am doing this thing, I have to believe it will be bigger than me. My dreams die in a vacuum.

\[2\] Pareto's Alpha, or the [Pareto Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_index), is a measure of income distribution across a population. I was first introduced to the concept in Benoit Mandelbrot’s _(Mis)Behavior of Markets_. The base concept is that wealth follows a Pareto Rule, with 80% of wealth being concentrated with 20% of the population. While some imbalance must exist to apply voltage across the economy, our belief is that is does not need to be as one-sided.

\[3\] There weren't that many comforts. The decision was not difficult.
