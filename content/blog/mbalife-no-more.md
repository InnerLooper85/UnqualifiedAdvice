**I DID IT!!!**

On the 10th of December, 2022, I had the honor of walking on the field at Minute Maid Park to receive an MBA. I worked to earn that moment on the field for two-and-a-half years.

Boy, was it a letdown.

Sure, my family (love you Mom!) was there giving me all the love and praise one could hope for. But I... eh. The moment was bittersweet.

**The Sweet**

First and foremost, my wife wins this section. She LOVES a good graduation. Since I first met her, until mid-last-year, Jamie worked in public education. One thing educators love to see is students graduate. When it came to my graduation weekend, it was more important to her than anyone that it went well.

It did.

Her joy and enthusiasm about the achievement was infectious to all (love you, babe!) My mom and stepdad drove down from West Lafayette, Indiana to Houston, Texas. If 20 hours in a Kia doesn't say love, what does?

Until last month, my mother and I had three college degrees between us — my mom is a smart cookie. Despite that, neither of us had attended a college graduation. Had it not been for Jamie's infectious enthusiasm, I am pretty sure we'd both have missed this one.

At the end of the weekend, Mom and I both confided in each other that we were happy to have gone.

**The Bitter**

That moment when you get that piece of paper... nothing changes.

The change has already happened. When you spend 30 months in a cocoon, you are not surprised by comments on your development of wings. You are looking for ways to use them.

In those 30 months, you have interacted with people outside of your normal sphere. You've sat through six hours of lecture every week. Six hours where you are either learning something or talking shit in the GroupMe. Sometimes, not learning anything was more fun than learning, because of your classmates.

What's changed as you cross the stage, is that you are no longer _going_ back to school_._ Now, you have _gone_ back to school. The fun part (if you are like me) is over. Now, it is on _you_ to go out and make use of that piece of paper and extra letters on the end of your name.

Good things that come from any degree are not something that "just happen". You have to put in thoughtful effort. You will probably have to have to market yourself. This marketing could be attending a job fair, sharing your résumé online or having a conversation with your boss(es). Or, it could be writing a blog \[1\].

You have to find new airspace for those wings you've developed. And you have to make sure you find airspace that you want to fly in.

I, personally, look forward to it.

**Is an MBA for You?**

Should you go get an MBA? Or, more generally, should you go back to school? My experience has left me feeling so enabled and empowered, that I cannot help but want to say yes. _My_ time and effort have been worth it. But that is not the right answer for everyone.

I work with some amazingly talented individuals that do not have a college degree. It tears me up on the inside when I hear people say "you've gotta' go to college!"

I know this to be an untruth.

In our American Minds, a proper education isn't complete without a bachelors degree. We think this way to a fault. Our systems, from elementary-to-high-school, set this as the bar for success. If you don't go to college, then the education system either thinks you are a failure or they have failed you. Again, this is not accurate.

If I felt this this way, why go spend the time to earn _another_ degree?

In the corporate world, we exemplify this education bias. We do so by overweighting the importance of degree holders compared to our "uneducated" workforce. We hold certain positions open for people with four-year-degrees and zero-experience. It does not matter that a position could be better filled by someone with a decade of experience, but no degree. In the corporate landscape, four years in a classroom is worth more than a decade of practical experience. It is how it is. It sucks.

If you want to get past certain gates, an MBA can be a default requirement. If you are in this position... sure. Go get an MBA. If you _want_ to.

Otherwise? I dunno. Do you _want_ to?

Are there good reasons to keep learning?

Yes.

**Two Reasons, Kneel Before You**

For me, my first reason for continuing my education was frustration. After a decade of experience, I entered a managerial role in 2017. I had never had anyone reporting to me and one day I found myself overseeing about 75 employees. Going from 0 reports to 75 was one hell of a healthy-stressor \[2\]. I had to learn a lot. I had to learn it fast.

In my first year, I was sent to a one-week training called Management Essentials II. Management Essentials I was for people below my level, who have only a handful of employees. It was a nice week. I was looking forward to more, in due time. Unfortunately, more never came.

From that week in fall of 2017 until 2020, my company provided me no other training opportunities. I was frustrated. I _wanted_ to get better and ended up making my own opportunity.

In the time since I started working on an MBA, my company has provided me no other training opportunities. I am glad I took it upon myself \[3\]. At times, I have felt rewarded by the experience, purely because it felt selfish.

If learning is your bag, then yes, do it. For me, getting to earn an MBA was like 30 months of going to a spa twice-a-week. It was heaven.

My second reason for seeking an MBA relates to an old study about playing chess.

Back in the 1973, Herbert Simon and William Chase published and article in the _American Scientist_. It was an analysis of chess players and how their ability compared to the time they had spent mastering the game. Simon and Chase found that nobody had reached a grandmaster level without 10,000 hours of playing. This number was later passed on as a threshold for expertise by Malcolm Gladwell in his book _Outliers_.

What is interesting, is in the original analysis, 10,000 hours was a decade’s worth of studying chess. In Real Life, 10,000 hours of experience takes about 5 years to accumulate. In Corporate Life, it can happen in 3 years, depending.

In 2020, after 3 years in the same role in Corporate Life , I had started to become an expert at what I was doing. For me, this translated to becoming bored. I was busy, for sure, but I was no longer interested in my day-to-day. I found myself in a rinse-and-repeat mindset that was doing nobody any good.

Thus, my second reason: I was bored.

Earning an MBA made me not bored. Learning new ideas in class and getting to look for ways to apply them is fun. At least for this nerd.

Are you feeling bored? If yes, learning something new will help! Whether it ends up in a degree or not does not matter. If it engages your mind, it's worth it.

**Notes**

\[1\] ;)

\[2\] I am becoming fascinated by what is a healthy stressor, thanks to my current read _[Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_\(book\))_. We usually view any stress as bad. The thing is, stress makes us stronger. I do not think I'd have ever grown as much as I have, if I was never asked to do more than I thought myself capable.

\[3\] I dit it purely out of my desire to improve myself. My own internal _want_. My company did not pay for any of my degree. I feel no loyalty to them. Employers desiring to keep their employees may want to note this.
