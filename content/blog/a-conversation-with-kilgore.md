**Goings On**

I mentioned in my last post how excited I have been about this term's Corporate Finance class. I was hoping to tell you all about the cool stuff we were learning. Then I went and ghosted you for the last month. Oops!

Summer terms in my MBA program are dense and quick. Corporate Finance and Supply Chain Management have ended. Now, it's onto Management of Information Flows (lots of databases) and Managerial Economics. Working in oil & gas has been... demanding? I've started about a half-dozen posts that I haven't been able to figure out how to finish.

Before we get to the main story, I'd like to say a bit about those as-yet, unfinished posts. A lot of... things... have been going on in the world. I'm still working out **how** to speak to the ones I have **experience** to speak to in this forum.

One topic that I have some authority on is energy and oil. I studied how energy flows when I was an absolute ball of it in my college years. Since then, I have spent about 14 years involved in producing it. Our (humanity's) relationship with energy is rife with complex emotions and bias. The one thing that compares in complexity to our emotional relationship with energy is how we get that energy.

We need energy. It gets us from point A to B, keeps us warm when it is cold, hot when it is warm, and powers our devices. I do not like that we burn oil \[1\] for energy. My neck supports a thick, candy shell filled with chocolate. That chocolate is convinced burning more oil is going to have bad consequences in the long term.

Because we need it... we keep buying it. We HAVE to. But, producing it is becoming a problem right now.

Why?

In general, [entropy](https://slowvsm.substack.com/p/organizing-the-rainbow?r=11xjyw&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).

Specifically? Heterogeneity and complacency.

I am not giving terse answers to try to sound smart. Or to be sarcastic. Or to appear prophetic or smart. I'm pretty fucking dumb.

But, as I see it, we have a major problem in being able to match supply type with demand type. Russia and their atrocious actions, of course, are contributing to this. But in reality, I think, the War is only accelerating our realization of an underlying problem. A problem that was going to appear sooner or later. To some it seems this may be appearing sooner. To me, it feels like its appearing quite late.

More on this to come...

**Time to Brag**

In my life, I have gotten to work with naturally talented people who didn't work particularly hard. I've worked with some people that lacked natural talent, but knew how to get results by grinding. My UHD classmates have given me the pleasure of working with people that are naturally talented **and** hard-working.

For the main content of this post, I wanted to share the final product of the efforts of my Corporate Finance team. Our first project focused on fundamental analysis and valuation of Coca-Cola. The final project tasked us to help "fellow student, Daniel," with his portfolio. Daniel's goal? Diversify his holdings, which were completely in Starbucks.

The attached are the results of our efforts. I am proud of them. We received an average of a 98.5%, so I guess we did okay.

Many thanks to [Anh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tranal), [Krystal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystal-lyons-13831118) and [Ato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ato-campbell-b892a4128) for their hard work and allowing me to share this with the world. You guys are great.

Notes

\[1\] I'm using “oil” here in the "royal we" sense as a stand in for all fossil fuels. Feel free to sub out with coal, natural gas, or biodiesel in your preferred proportions.
