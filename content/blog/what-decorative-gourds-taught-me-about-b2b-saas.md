This post is a joke… for, like, 10 people? Does having to renew software licenses bring rage to your heart? Are you a fan of [decorative gourd season](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers) \[1\]?

Do you like piña coladas?

If not, there is probably no reason to proceed. Unless… are you into B2B SaaS Jokes? Or _Silicon Valley_ references? Or cursing like a sailor? Or enjoy the works of E.E. Cummings?

Here’s a little map I made to help you determine if the rest of this post is for you. If it makes sense, proceed. If not, I mean, do what you want.

_Mom_, please just stop now.

I don’t know about you, but I can’t wait to dig my hands into some software licensing contracts and juice our fucking margins. I’m about to head down to legal right now and get my hands on every single one that’s up for renewal. Then I’m gonna stop by the supply closet and take all the fucking red pens and highlighters Sharon just ordered from Staples – go ahead Sharon, order more, these ones are as good as used up – then I’m gonna take it all down to the Executive Conference Room. I’m gonna lay it all out in piles and when everyone shows up for the review, it’s gonna be like BLAMMO! Let’s show our customers how _**valuable**_ we are! Guess what season it is!? It’s fucking software license renewal season. There’s the smell of blood in the water and our client list is full of sticky customers who can’t afford to research — _let alone switch to_ — a better fucking provider.

I’m gonna build a chart showing how our prices are _just pacing_ with inflation and rising employment costs. I’m gonna use it to tell our clients how, _we’re sorry but this is the best we can offer them this year_. And I’m gonna use the same fucking line on the new ones, too! And one of you will be like, “aren’t our overhead and marginal costs next to 0?” And I’m just gonna add another line item to our Cybersecurity Maintenance Contract — without breaking their gaze — and say, “It’s software license renewal season, fuckfaces. I’ve noticed a lot of new Mercedes in the parking lot this year. Next year, I want to see a Bentley or two. You’re either ready to reap this freaky harvest or you’re not.”

Carving up contracts sounds like a fitting way to wring in the season. You know what else does? Performing a reenactment of the moment Salesforce revolutionized software from a product to a service! Remember when we used to just be able to charge people _**once**_ for this shit? _But I don’t need a service. These updates are just constant bullshit._ Well, you know what isn’t bullshit? Chinese hackers and our fucking margins!

Speaking of margins, be sure to point out the 20% hike to our development surcharge when you’re dealing with clients. If they sign a 5-year deal, they’ll avoid future hikes like this. We’re gonna make that annual revenue recur, motherfuckers! You know why? Because it’s fucking software license renewal season and next year we’re holding the company retreat in fucking Tahiti. Have you ever been to Tahiti?!? We’re going next year and you can come along, assuming you can get your idiot clients to agree to sign up for a 3-year Support and Care Package. Fucking morons.

To help you, I’m gonna have DevOps push a new color scheme to the portal. Make it look all new and fresh, but without breaking anything like usual. We’ve gotta show our clients that _we’re constantly making improvements_. Then I’m gonna take these marked up contracts back to legal and do lines of blow off them with Suzie from HR, while the lawyers finalize the details.

Why?

Because, it’s not Q1, it’s not Q2, it’s not Q3…

It’s fucking software license renewal season! Put a fucking reminder in your Outlook calendar and pull your heads out of your collective asses. The fiscal year is about to end and our clients lose connectivity to their databases at the end of the year… _if they don’t renew_.

Now go out there and sell, fuck-heads!
