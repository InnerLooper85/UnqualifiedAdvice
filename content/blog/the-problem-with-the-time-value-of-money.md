**The Time Value of Money**

May has been a crazy month in #MBALife. A few days after closing out finals, we hopped right into our summer classes. The summer schedule is a bit grueling, with a semester’s worth of content compressed into 6-week terms. Last summer was tough, but quite a lot of fun for me. I spent my study and spare time practicing portfolio development, management, and analysis. The summer's learnings culminated in writing a client prospectus and delivering a pitch. I enjoyed every moment of it.

This summer I'm getting to enjoy Managerial Finance. We are practicing reading financial statements, such as a 10-K report, to analyze the performance and value of a company. I am jazzed \[1\]. Last summer I spent a lot of time studying this topic for Advanced Corporate Finance. At the time we were looking at the lens of managing a company’s finances. Now we get to build off that experience and analyze a company's performance.

One thing paid a lot of attention in an MBA program, especially one focused on finance, is the time value of money. You are a pretty smart person, no? You're reading this. In my mind that makes you a smart person.

How would you describe "time value of money?” I asked a bunch of you through various channels. Thanks to all who replied!

I’m working on my next post and have a question: What does the phrase “time value of money” mean to you? How do you think the concept impacts your life?

Here are some of my favorite responses:

> "It means 'take the money now' because, invested wisely, it will grow."
> 
> "How much your money will be worth at some point in the future."
> 
> "The earnings you could make with an amount of money you don't currently have."
> 
> "One dollar today is worth more than one dollar in the future, because it has the potential to earn interest and increase in absolute value"
> 
> "How much money I can make per unit of time."
> 
> "The cash value of things will continue to rise up. No matter how expensive things are now, it will be more expensive in the future. Just like how people from the past always talk about how it cost then “a lot” to buy things then, but when we compare it to the present it is very cheap."

You all get it! Each of you may bring a different take, but you get all the basic concept:

A dollar today is unlikely to have the same intrinsic value as a dollar at a previous or future date.

That's it. That is all you need to know. The rest is derived from context or bias. We understand that money's value through time is variable. But, I have a question for you. Do you understand why? I only ask because I am pretty sure I don’t have a full grasp of it myself.

To get to the root of something I don't understand, I often find it find it is useful to flip it.

**Strike That; Reverse It**

Let's look to the inverse of the time value of money: the money value of time. Time is globally infinite and locally finite. For each of us, time is a true scarce-resource. We all only have so many minutes. I may earn more for each minute I work today than I did 5 years ago. In 5 years, I may earn the same for each minute I work as I do today. The dollars change, but the progression of time is constant.

For each of us time has a different monetary value per unit. Ultimately, as we build up a savings account that stored monetary value can feel like a store of saved time. I believe this is a driver of many of the unhealthy emotions that make talking about money hard.

In my mind, the scarcity of time is what drives the the ever changing value money. Imagine you are on a game show where you win a vacation package. The vacation package has two options:

Option A - In the next 6 months, you get a 1-week vacation package for two. All costs to take the vacation from the moment you leave your front door to the moment you get home are part of the prize.

Option B - In 3 years, you get the same deal but with a 2-week duration. All you have to do is wait around for a few years and your vacation has not only paced with inflation, but doubled. Pretty sweet deal!

Now, ask yourself three questions:

1.  Which option would have more value for you today?
    
2.  Imagining yourself 10-years in the past, which option has more value for you?
    
3.  Imagining yourself 10-years in the future, which option has more value for you
    

How do your answers look? Mine are all the same?I It surprises me, but I'd choose Option-A in every scenario.

1.  Looking at the choice today: my wife and I do not have kids and have few non-work-related obligations. We both expect our salaries to increase over the next several of years. The immediacy of a free vacation adds more utility than a longer vacation at an unknown future date.
    
2.  10-years ago, my wife and I were in the throes planning our wedding and honeymoon. You'd better believe a free week vacation package would have fit nicely into the plan.
    
3.  10-years in the future? I still see life looking a lot like today, aside from the world of changes that are bound to come.
    

However, if I were the parent of a newborn, I could imagine Option-B looking pretty appealing? In the next 6 months, you're not likely to want to leave your baby. But in 3-years? Drop the brat off with the grandparents and "Hello, Fiji!".

I expect if we all compared answers, we'd have a lot of variation. This hypothetical variation speaks to the power of considering the money-value-of-time. Why do I say that? If we only look at the net present value of the options (i.e. the time value of money), we'd all reach the same conclusion. I haven't provided enough hypothetical information to say which would be better. But one would prove out to bet better in all situations, if you were only looking at the textbook time value of money\[2\].

When we factor in the unique situations that each of us face in our lives, this changes. My opportunity costs are different from yours. Just like yours are different than you buddy Ted's. The relative value of team is different to each of us in ways that cannot always be captured in a model.

This whole discussion brings me back to my little survey from before and my favorite response:

@slowvsm @MeasureTwiceMNY @MichaelKitces @jposhaughnessy @Jesse\_Livermore @JustinWolfers @JustinMcElroy @griffinmcelroy @travismcelroy @hodgman @nope\_its\_lily I’d broaden the question to value of time. Time value of money is sort of an easy thing. Dedicating your hours to your highest and best use is very hard. Peter Kaufman preaches happiness = accomplishment / regret. Focus on minimizing regret to maximize happiness.

@slowvsm @MeasureTwiceMNY @MichaelKitces @jposhaughnessy @Jesse\_Livermore @JustinWolfers @JustinMcElroy @griffinmcelroy @travismcelroy @hodgman @nope\_its\_lily I think you’re question goes to how to value your time. I don’t see how an answer is possible to derive without thinking of the bigger questions.

For those who aren't familiar with his work, Bill hosts [The Business Brew](https://www.thebusinessbrew.com) podcast. He is a fantastic interviewer and I thank him for taking the time to share his thoughts. He clearly knew the question was loaded with something a bit deeper.

The concept of happiness being a ratio of accomplishment to regret was new to me and striking. Thinking about how we can use out time to maximize our happiness rather than our dollars, seems like a good piece of life advice.

Notes

\[1\] The first-known use of the word Jazzed occurred in 1955. Perhaps its use here will go down in the books as one of the last known uses.

\[2\] There exists a technicality where this is not exactly accurate. Each person would potentially have a different required rate of return. This would give us some variation. But the heart of my argument, that the cold numbers alone are not capturing the true value stands.
