# Getting Started with Markdown

Writing blog posts in Markdown is easy and efficient. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

## Basic Syntax

### Headers

Use `#` for headers:
```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
```

### Emphasis

- *Italic* text uses `*asterisks*`
- **Bold** text uses `**double asterisks**`

### Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Unordered list
- Uses hyphens
- Or asterisks

### Links and Images

[Link to homepage](/) uses `[text](url)`

Images work similarly: `![alt text](image.jpg)`
