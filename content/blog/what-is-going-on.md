**Hard Times and Misery…**

is the name of a great dive bar in Galveston. If you are ever in the area, I recommend checking it out. Seriously though, It's rough out there, y'all. \[1\]

Inflation? It sucks, yeah? Things certainly were cheaper when I was a kid, I tell ya!

Mother Tuesdays called me up this week. She had a simple question. Her and Father Tuesday's retirement account had dropped a significant amount recently \[2\]. Naturally, as most humans tend to, she wanted to _understand why_. I am reminded of the words of Bokonon \[3\].

> Tiger got to hunt,  
> Bird got to fly;  
> Man got to sit and wonder, "Why, why, why?"  
>   
> Tiger got to sleep,  
> Bird got to land;  
> Man got to tell himself he understand

Mother, I don't have an \*answer\*. But I do have some ideas and I'd be happy to share them.

**First, Let's Talk About Being Curious**

So... y'all remember a while back, when we [talked about cliché](https://slowvsm.substack.com/p/everything-is-a-bead)? The term "interest rate" is another great example. Here's a scenario to demonstrate:

> Me: Hey, can I borrow $100? I'll I pay you back $100 next week.
> 
> You: No. But I'd be _interested_ if you paid me back $110 to make it worth my while.

See?! See what I did there? An interest rate is the rate of return someone needs for them to be interested in loaning out their capital.

> You: I knew that. Duh. You're dumb.
> 
> Me: Well, I had intuitively forgotten what an interest rate was. The term no longer existed as anything other than a placeholder for a variable in an equation. I thought it might be useful to remind others.

The level of interest people have in lending out their capital (a.k.a. money, a.k.a. time) has a BIG impact on the economy. We are a credit intensive society from the ground up. At the smallest unit-level, we have systems like "buy now, pay later" (BNPL). At the macro scale, we have corporate and government bonds. Every part of our system feels impacts when that pesky interest rate changes.

Is the next question on your mind, "how are interest rates set?" I hope so. It goes something like this:

1\. Everyday banks lend money to each other. There are many reasons why one bank would lend or borrow money from another. For our purposes, the only thing that matters is that they do and that they charge interest for lending. The rate banks charge each other is called the **federal funds rate**.

2\. Sometimes, banks don't have enough to lend each-other. This happens, it's no biggie. When this happens, banks borrow money (usually overnight) from the Federal Reserve (a.k.a The Fed). The Fed charges them for this at the **discount rate.**

3\. Based upon the rates above, Mr. Market goes to work and sets the **prime rate**. The prime rate usually determines what you and I pay for credit (interest). The prime rate is driven by the federal funds and discount rates.

Pop quiz: of the three rates discussed, which of them is set and controlled by The Fed:

A) The Federal Funds Rate

B) The Discount Rate

C) Te Prime Rate

D) Screw you, nobody said anything about a quiz

If you answered D, props. I never said anything about a quiz. Way to stand up for yourself.

If you answered B, you are correct. The Fed sets and controls the discount rate. They _recommend_ a rate for the federal funds rate, but do not actually control it. Banks can ignore it to some degree, bur they usually align.

To picture how this all works, let's imagine a cast of characters:

I imagine \[4\] communications happen something like this:

In this scenario, Mr. Fargo is trying to borrow (whoah four dollar signs?!? seems like a lot) from Ms. Morgan. After doing some checking of her balance sheet, basically balancing her checkbook, she sees she has $$ to lend out and will do so at X%. Since this is between banks, it is likely going to be at the **federal funds rate**. Mr. Fargo, still needs and additional ofliquidity.So,TheFedstepsinandofferstoloadhim at Y%, which will _definitely_ be at the **discount rate**.

Now let us imagine that tomorrow you or I were call up Mr. Fargo or Ms. Morgan’s bank to take out a loan for, say $, Mr. Fargo or Ms. Morgan would look at their balance sheets and determine each of their **prime rates**. Then, after looking over our credit report, they would offer us (credit worthy customers) loans at Z%, which will be the prime rate plus an adjustment for risk and, of course, profit.

_**Why**_ **are Rates Important?**

That is a mighty fine question you just asked in your head when you read that heading. Well done.

Changes in interest rates change the time value of money. Or the [money value of time](https://slowvsm.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-the-time-value-of). If The Fed decides it isn't interested in loaning money to banks for less than 1%, the effect cascades. If banks are paying 1% interest on what they borrow, they will charge their customers a mark-up on that.

This increased mark-up drives up the cost to borrow money. The increased cost to borrow, drives down demand to borrow. The result is that less money ends up being available to cycle through the economy.

As rate changes are processed in the market, the _prices_ of stocks and bonds change. When interest rates are rising, stocks and bonds tend to decline. These declines happen because as interest rates rise — or inflation strikes! — there is a decrease in what a dollar today is worth tomorrow. Ultimately, today's dollars are worth less in the future. This causes a price drop today.

My perspective is that interest rates are the basis of a ton of "blind math", as I like to call it. What is "blind math"? Blind math is changing the input of variables based only limited data (i.e. a recent change in interest rates). What ends up happening with blind math is a tendency to allow for recency bias and anchoring to take effect. As a result, we allow recent variation to have an outsized impact on long term decisions. \[5\]

**If you Weren't Confused Enough...**

What is even going on with oil? I can't answer that with any level of precision. But, I can say I expect continued volatility. Inventories, supply, and demand are out of whack. That means things are gonna change and swing more than we are used to for the foreseeable future.

Why did the price of a barrel of oil fall, but gas prices didn't fall as much? I have some insights into that, which I am putting together for a larger piece \[6\]. I am firmly in the camp that society has been underinvesting in our energy and raw material sources.

Energy and raw materials are ugly. They don't translate to Instagram. Much like being a garbage collector, I imagine few people dream of being a deck-hand on an oil rig. But everyone should agree both are needed for society to function. Both are jobs that few dream of holding that we all should be thankful people do.

I can't predict what the price of oil will be in a few months. But, I can say that we will need more raw materials. Parts of our society want to push massive change. Other parts want things to stay as they are. Both parts need similar inputs to realize their goals.

If you want radical change, you likely want:

1\. Move away from energy sources dedicated to fossil fuels.

2\. Not to go broke.

3\. Stop the madness. It seems like everything sucks and it is all threatening your existence.

If you want things to stay the same, you likely want:

1\. Maintain a strong supply of energy, regardless of the source

2\. Experience minimal impact to profits/losses, resulting from energy prices.

3\. Stop the madness. It seems like everything sucks and it is all threatening your existence.

To me, neither stance is incorrect or morally abhorrent. I think your view depends greatly on your life experiences and your personal lens.

Through everything, the single most important piece of advice I can share is simple:

**DO NOT PANIC!**

This quarter, we have all seen declines in the value of our investments. It is a time of market decline. Declines in the market are part of natural cycles. The market tends to do two things on the whole. First, it goes up more than it goes down. Second, when it does go down, it goes down quicker than it goes up. This leads us to worry and despair. Don't let the worry drive you to bad decisions.

**Cultivating Figs**

On the more personal front, I passed an exam. A lot of people have passed it. But a lot more people have not. That exam, the Series 65, was the one hurdle to opening Fig that worried me. I studied hard and, in the end, it was easy. When I finished and got the result, it felt amazing. I wish this was a more dramatic or exciting story, but also I am glad it isn't.

What's up next for Fig?

Paperwork! Paperwork! Paperwork! Now that I got that pesky exam out of the way, Fig can finish the process to become a Registered Investment Advisor.

What does that mean?

Fig Social Capital is opening for business real soon.

**Notes** (If you’re not checking out the notes, what are you even doing here?)

\[1\] I moved to Texas in May of 2008. 14 years later, I'm finally willing to admit that "y'all" is a superior pronoun. Get over it, Yankees.

\[2\] For the record, I do not manage their retirement account. Nor am I saying I could or would have done any better.

\[3\] [Books are fun to read](https://bookshop.org/books/cat-s-cradle-9780385333481/9780385333481). Kurt Vonnegut’s _Cat’s Cradle_ is no exception. Depending on the edition, this poem is somewhere around page 81.

\[4\] This is a simplified model. And probably not to scale. If details are super important to you, I recommend doing some of your own research. Also, tell me where I am wrong! I know I am not perfect in my understanding. The feedback is welcomed.

\[5\] I’m applying some knowledge from my [current read](https://bookshop.org/books/thinking-fast-and-slow/9780374533557) here. It is probably not for everyone, but it is fascinating stuff! I’ve been working on the bones of a future post overlaying this with what I gleaned from _[The Master and His Emissary](https://bookshop.org/books/the-master-and-his-emissary-the-divided-brain-and-the-making-of-the-western-world-expanded/9780300245929)_. If you don’t feel like reading these tomes but are interested in the content, then stay tuned!

\[6} I've been studying refineries and the equipment needed for processing various grades of crude. Thankfully, I saved some of the textbooks I accrued during my time working in a chem plant. I remain a dope, but I've learned a few things worth sharing. So much future content going on!
