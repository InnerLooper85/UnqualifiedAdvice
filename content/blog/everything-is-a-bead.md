**Things You May Not Know About Me**

I hope what I write here impacts a multigenerational audience. I hope some of you have far more experience than I do. I hope some of you have less. I hope I am Goldilocks. My experience as an only-then-middle-child \[1\] kind of dictates that I feel this way, in general. But I _want_ it to be true in this instance.

I want those with 30 years of experience to unite with people who have 3 years. I want them to come together in a a chorus of, "bullshit, that's not how any of this works... at least _I don't think_ it is!" If you all say this, you heard me and thought about what you heard. That is all I ask. My experiences and life lessons are not universal, but they are what I have to relay.

Where do those experiences come from? I have held jobs with 6 companies in the last 21 years. At a high level, my roles over those years can be boiled down the following;

-   After-school/summer childcare provider
    
-   Engineering coop \[2\]
    
-   Server/bartender
    
-   Engineering
    
-   Sales plus some engineering
    
-   Management with an engineering and sales flare
    

The first three roles on that list were while I was still in school. Though some predate my professional career, every one of these job helped me build skills I use on a daily basis. The overlap of the childcare/serving-inebriated-patrons/managing people Venn Diagram is large. Trust me.

I got my first paying job at 16 with the YMCA, where bureaucracy and hierarchies are strong. I had spent the previous three years in the counselor-in-training (CIT) program. This meant I had a job guaranteed the day I turned 16. To be a CIT, I first had to become a junior counselor (JC). To become a JC, I had to earn nine "beads" representing different qualities. After proving your worth and earning the ninth bead, you also received a tenth bead. This last bead represented your membership in the very-uncool and exclusive JC club. Here are the beads I remember:

1.  Patience
    
2.  Listening
    
3.  Leadership
    
4.  Caring
    
5.  Honesty
    
6.  Safety
    
7.  Nature
    
8.  8\. ?
    
9.  9\. ?
    

I wish I knew what I was forgetting\[3\]. The seven I do remember have served me well. The camp director always used to say, "patience is a bead." It was so overused it became a joke around camp. But it is now engrained in my vernacular. I try to remember to say it when I'm feeling pressure.

**Still Working on That Listening Bead**

One thing I've learned as a manager, is it is TOUGH to figure out how to give negative feedback. As an employee, one thing I've always felt missing from every manager I've had is the negative feedback. I'm not perfect. So I call bullshit. I've messed up… so, call me on it?

As a manager... I GET IT! I've gotten more confident in acknowledging my contributions. And I realize that I may be a pretty good employee. One that doesn't need a lot of course correction. Now, I have a wonderful team full of people that are very much in the same boat. They do wonderful things. I hate to criticize them for fear of demoralizing them. But this is BAD! It is the ONE THING I've always felt missing.

So, I've been trying to make it a point to offer direct feedback on poor outcomes. When something doesn't go as planned, your team knows. They don't like that that the outcome wasn't good and want to do better. As a manager, the most important thing we can do is step-back, evaluate, and offer direction on a new course. Don't be afraid to examine and discuss what went wrong and what needs to change. Offer insights to your team on different ways to approach and handle tough decisions. Tell them where they may have gone wrong (without being a jerk about it)! They will appreciate you for it.

Why do I say all this when my first message was "Listen"? I've learned lately that the critical feedback I'm seeking is often there, if I know where to find it. Lately, I've been paying more attention to the small-and-off-handed comments my bosses make. There are a lots of small nudges they give. I’ve started listening and found lots of help in those little asides. I bet your manager is doing the same, if you know what to listen for.

**I'm Rubber, You're Glue, and We're Both Getting Burnt Out**

I have spent more time in my life thinking about rubber than you have or ever will. I am confident in making this statement, knowing that it will be true for at least 98% of the people reading it. Of the last twenty-one years, I spent about ten in rubber manufacturing. I'd love to try to get you excited about this, but we both have better uses of our time. I will say, the one thing all my work with rubber has taught me is to be flexible.

Why do I mention all this? In #MBALife this week, I studied the concept of burnout in organizations. It got me thinking about how to manage my staff (and myself) to avoid burnout. And it got me thinking about the clichéd terms burnout and bandwidth. Every way I went, I kept coming back to a mental model a based on a humble rubber band. But first, we need to discuss cliché.

In _The Master and His Emissary_, Dr. Iain McGilchrist explores the effect of terms becoming cliché. I took from my reading, that metaphors becomes more-and-more meaningless over time. Initially, we create a phrase that conveys something beyond the words it is comprised of. Doing so gives us power to describe things in unique and abstract terms. Shakespeare was adept at using this power, I have heard.

Why does this power fade? Metaphorical phrases are created and conceived by the right hemisphere of our brains. When they live here, the terms have added depth. The right hemisphere also governs much of our physical spatial reasoning. Metaphors take the meaning of the individual parts of our mental models and juxtapose them in a new way to create deeper meaning. The novelty of this arrangement fades as it becomes commonplace. As a result, terms that may have had an impactful meaning when created can become "blah, blah, synergy, blah."

Why am I spending so much time on explaining clichés? I want to help you reclaim two of them from the vault of your left brain and renew their meaning:

-   Burnout
    
-   Bandwidth
    

Have you ever said to yourself, "ugh, I'm feeling so burnt out!"? Go ahead... nobody is listening. You can admit it.

I've said it to myself! And I wish I had done a better job of _listening_ to myself. If you don't use that listening bead when you self-reflect, you miss a lot of the benefit. My listening was imparied by admitting to a deep emotion described by a term that had no real meaning to me. I was saying I felt some-kinda-way, without understanding what I was really feeling.

So, let's do a little thought experiment together. Look at the word and ponder the images that come to your mind

Burnout

**BURNOUT**

Burn. Out.

What did you think of? Maybe images of a the shell of a building after a fire filled your head. Maybe you thought of the rocket engines on the space shuttle. You could have imagined Matthew McConaughey’s role is Dazed and Confused.

The term was first coined by psychologist Herbert Freudenberger in the 1970's. He came up with the term after observing patients holding cigarettes, not smoking them, until they turned to ash and burnt out. He suffered from the condition and wrote about it in _[Burnout: the high cost of achievement](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL4404240M/Burn-out)._ To my mind, what you picture is not important to anyone outside of your own head. But _you_ should pay attention to it!

What's that, you asked? What came to _my_ mind?

This:

No single image can capture an emotion or feeling in full. But, imagining myself as the tire in this describes a big part of what I feel when I am experiencing burnout.

Revving the engine. Trying to move something forward. Not getting anywhere. Leaving a lot on the pavement and leaving myself a lot thinner.

Shall we dig a bit deeper? I think so. but let's replace the tire with that humble rubber band I mentioned earlier. At this point, we can call it Checkoff's rubber band. Go ahead and picture one. It's probably round and tidy. I will do my best to draw it. Let's see how it goes.

[You know, for kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G5F8ObYgjI)? Now imagine cutting it and laying it out so it looks something like below... it will have some natural curl in it's slack state. This is the natural state our model wants to be in. It will try to get back into this state. This simple strip of rubber represents a person and their bandwidth.

Now, let's try to burn them out!

I have not done a survey. But, I imagine if I did a very high percentage of people would respond that "stress" is a contributor to burnout. Defining what stress is for real people can be... difficult. Different people have different stressors. But for our straightened-rubber-band-model person, it's pretty easy to define. The stress our model is feeling is the amount of force acting on it over (that is to say, divided by) the cross-sectional area.

Did you think you were getting away without some engineering this week? I was about to let you off the hook, but couldn't help myself. I did resist using greek-letters as variables.

There you have it. The stress is simply the amount of force applied to our model divided by it's area. But how to we relate this force and our "cross sectional area" to our ourselves and our work? Well, thankfully there's another simple equation to help.

In our rubber band model, imagine holding both ends and applying force. At first it straightens until taut and then... stretches. The force applied to the band through the distance we stretched it an amount of work applied.

Remember what I said about that band wanting to return to it's natural state? It will pull back on what is applying those forces and exibit work of it's own. There is much to explore here, but that is the basic idea.

Anyway, after doing some math...

Okay, that's cool for a model of a rubber band, but what would that mean for me? The one under stress!? We're going to replace the “equal sign” with the “proportional sign”, because we are moving from talking about measurable numbers to concepts. Distance gets replaced by "project duration". This describes the amount of time you may have to complete something. It could be a measure in either physical or temporal distance. And we replace surface area with the term bandwidth.

The stress an employee is feeling is proportional to the ratio of their workload over the product of the project duration and their bandwidth. That is a tricky sentence, I know. But once you think it out, I hope it makes some intuitive sense.

Now that we understand how work applies stress to our model, let's talk about that bandwidth cliché. I imagine when most people hear "bandwidth" their mind immediately jumps their internet connection. In these terms, bandwidth is equivalent to the amount of data it can handle. Roughly the amount of work that channel can handle.

This is useful in the rubber band model. In our model the cross sectional area of the band is it's "bandwidth". I know, area =/= distance... bad engineering. Whatever. The more force your apply, through work, over the bandwidth the more likely the band will fail. It will literally (yes, literally) snap from overwork.

Now, here is the interesting wrinkle of this model. Have you been paying attention to the units? If you have been, you will realize the nature of these relationship is not linear. There's... a lot of distance units on the bottom of that equation. But this makes sense, if you know something about rubber bands.

When placed under stress, their cross sectional area... shrinks! If you are reading this at your desk and have one within arms reach, give it a try. So as you add more force, by adding more work, the force gets shared across a smaller area.

Each little bit of stretch we apply to the rubber band requires more force and the band thins out. This means that for each extra unit of work, employee stress increases by more than one unit.

What can you take away from this?

More work = more force = more stretch = less bandwith

Take care to manage your workload—and your employee's workload if you're a manager. The impacts of overwork are exponential. The hidden demon lies with overwork reducing your total bandwidth as you become stretched too thin.

**Notes**

\[1\] I was an only-child by birth then a middle-child by marraige. Starting life as an only child, gave me entry into the "rule-following, narcissists club." This is a term I'm stealing from the memoirs _Vacationland_ and _Medallion Status_ by humorist John Hodgman. Having been, at least in part, an only child, I have never heard the feelings described better. If you want to check them out, I recommend the audiobook versions. Listening to him relay the stories in his own tone adds to the experience.

\[2\] Being an engineering coop is like being a super intern. Purdue University offers a wonderful cooperative education program. I rotated every other term between working for the same company and going to school. By the time I graduated, I had over two-years of real-world engineering experience.

\[3\] I have been thinking about what I would replace them with if it were up to me. I'll report back once I've figured that out.
