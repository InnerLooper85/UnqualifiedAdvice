## Seeking the Muse

Hi there readers! I’ve missed you! Where have I been? Sometimes I don’t know where to start. I get overwhelmed because there is just…

To get help, I decided to ask someone to be my muse. I turned to a younger colleague and asked: _do_ _you have any questions about investing that I could help answer_?

They did.

#### The Questions

> 1.  Where do I start?
>     
> 2.  What makes the biggest impact with least amount of risk? (or varying levels of risk maybe)
>     
> 3.  Is there an easy way to invest on your own or is it better to pay someone else to manage?
>     
> 4.  A general understanding of the different options would be super helpful, I think. Maybe pros and cons of each. I recently watched a movie called “The Big Short” where they had celebs do cameos explaining financial ideas in a comical way. It seemed to help my understanding for some reason.
>     
> 5.  Is there a minimum dollar amount you should start with?
>     
> 6.  Can you approximate expected returns?
>     
> 7.  What are the main risks, if any?
>     
> 8.  What are some good resources to learn more in depth on your own?

Thanks for a damn fine list! Let’s get right to it!

Well… almost right to it. I’m going to save Question 1 for last. Asking where you start is a reasonable first question. But, it isn’t the best place to really start. You’ll see why as we go.

### Question 2

Question 2 nails it: **“What makes the biggest impact with the least amount of risk?”**

This. This is where you start.

The answer is dead-simple. The biggest impact you can have is to increase your income.

Increasing your income is as risk-free as you can get. If you save a constant percentage of your earnings (my recommended default), you’ll see both your take home check and investment savings increase with each income gain. You won’t feel like you are saving more, even though you are. \[1\]

If you are like me, you want that investment account you’re feeding to grow as quick as possible. You’re going to want to do other things. We’ll talk about them soon, but trust me, the biggest impact you can have is to increase your income.

No amount of investing wizardry can make up for a bigger paycheck, from which you dutifully save a percentage of into a well-managed investment account.

### Question 3

Is there an easy way to invest on your own or is it better to pay someone else to help manage your money?

#### Disclaimer

**Here’s the thing. I opened a business, Fig Social Capital, to help people create financial plans and manage their investments. I make money when people come to me to manage their investments. I may have a conflict of interest in answering this question. Also, their is no definitive answer.**

#### Answer

Yes! There are many easy ways to invest on your own. Many of them are worth your consideration. I highly recommend Vanguard. They are just plain trustworthy. Trustworthy is my favorite adjective when describing financial institutions.

You want to know something weird? I’ve never actually had a Vanguard account, but I have sent more than a few people their way. Everyone of them has come back and said something like, “They and their website are really easy to work with. Thanks for the tip!”

Even though I’ve not had an account with them, I have regularly owned their Exchange Traded Funds (ETF’s) and Money Market Funds in my portfolio \[2\].

So, yes. You _can_ manage it on your own. Is it better to pay someone else to help manage your porfolio? That is a much harder question, and the only answer I can give to everyone reading is, _“maybe_.”

Even if you are managing a portfolio on your own, expect to pay _someone_ for the privilege of doing so, though the fees should me minimal (less than 0.5% of what you have invested). The question you want to ask is, _what services do I need and what are they worth to me_?

There are platforms out there that are great for helping you passively invest and plan your finances. They will ask you to answer some questions about your income level, investing experience, and risk level. Their algorithms will go to work and help create a solid portfolio of well-diversified ETF’s (kind of a redundant statement… iykyk). This is great if:

1.  You are a long way from retirement and just starting to build a nest egg.
    
2.  You are’t worrying about complex topics, like paying for college for your kids.
    
3.  The only milestone in your financial plan is having a chunk of money available on the first day of retirement.
    

Do those strictures apply to you? If so, then please, please, please go start an account. Here’s a frigging [link](https://investor.vanguard.com/home) \[3\].

If you find yourself saying, _that doesn’t quite sound like me,_ then you may want to consider looking for someone to help you. Advisors will, of course, charge you a fee. The type and amount of fees will vary based upon the services provided, which should be based upon your needs. Generally, there are two main fee structures you will encounter: fixed-fee and asset-based fees.

#### Fixed-Fee Structures

If you are a DIY’er and not afraid of spending a few hours a year making trades in your brokerage account, you may want to consider a fixed-fee advisory plan. How these plans work is simple. You sit down with your chosen advisor and share a bunch of super-intimate-feeling information. Then they go away for a bit.

After some time — and a follow-up conversation or two — they give you two things: a financial plan and a bill.

The plan should show you where you are (think balance sheet and income statement) and provide detailed guidance on how to get where you are going (think a recommendation for an investment portfolio). The bill should be for either a pre-negotiated, flat-fee or an invoice including the number of hours spent planning at a pre-negotiated hourly rate. This is a _great_ option if you are hands-on, just starting your investing journey, and/or have trust issues.

#### Asset-Based Structures

For some, the idea of logging into a brokerage account and executing trades to buy stocks, bonds or other securities, is intimidating, boring, or sounds like a hassle. If you are in this camp, then you may want someone who will help with the planning _and_ execution. In this arrangement, you typically will pay a fee that is based on a percentage of the assets you invest with the firm, referred to as assets under management or AUM.

They _should_ (I do for my clients) still want to sit down, talk through your financial history and future plans. Why? They still should craft a plan that puts you where you want to be. They’re just going to execute the investing portion for you.

After you meet and agree to your investment plan, they take money that you have deposited in an account and invest it for you. The amount of money in this account determines how much you are charged.

The account can be with the same firm that is advising you, like a Fidelity or Vanguard, or held with an independent third party custodian, like Interactive Brokers, that is managed by your advisor. Fees are deducted directly from your account, so you never receive a “bill” but will see a deduction on your quarterly statements.

#### What’s Better?

It depends.

Mmmmm!

Yeah!

Let that unsatisfying answer sink in.

See, it just depends on where you are in your life and your personal taste. You should consider your options and find a path that you are comfortable with. If that path includes a paid advisor, then you should damn-well find an advisor you trust.

Advisors may also be selective about the clients they work with. I am.

#### Who do I work with?

1.  I only work with people who give a shit.
    
    1.  They care about what is in their portfolio. They are curious about why it’s performed the way it has. They’re engaged and their engagement drives my desire to perform for them.
        
2.  I prefer to work with busy people, though they may be hard to pin down for meetings.
    
    1.  People who have demanding jobs — owning a company is acceptable, if not preferable — are focused on increasing their earnings. These are clients I love to work with. I have a burning passion for what I do. Not everyone does. Their time is best spent focusing on making more money doing what they love. I’m here to help them protect and grow what they save.
        
3.  I like to work with people not covered by a traditional retirement plan.
    
    1.  If your company provides an employer sponsored plan, you **should** also have access to retirement planning professionals. Reach out to them, ask what they do and what their fees are. If you don’t like what they have to say, shop around.
        
4.  I can add value for those with needs beyond a traditional retirement plan.
    
    1.  People with access to a Discounted Employee Stock Purchase Programs, or who receive Restricted Stock Units or Stock Options as part of their compensation.
        
    2.  People with independent brokerage accounts — everyone _really_ should have one.
        
    3.  People needing help with rollovers and conversions of old retirement plans.
        
5.  For clients on an AUM model, I only work with those willing and able to comfortably invest at least $25,000.
    
    1.  This limit is driven by how I value my time. For a year of management of $25,000, my fees would be about $500 (2% of AUM). For a by-the-hour financial planning services, I charge $250/hr. A well detailed financial plan requires, at my speed, a minimum of 10 hours of work. I am willing to discount my early work for people investing with me for the long-term (AUM accounts) and don’t discount my time for those only interested in the short term. This is how I think. Take it or leave it,
        
6.  In my dreams, I work with clients that are only rich and like the cut of my jib \[4\].
    

### Question 4

A general understanding of the different options would be super helpful, I think. Maybe pros and cons of each. I recently watched a movie called “The Big Short” where they had celebs do cameos explaining financial ideas in a comical way. It seemed to help my understanding for some reason.

Answer:

Ah yes, a general understanding of the different options would be great. Unfortunately, we are already pushing 2,000 words here.

Let’s table this one for later? I cannot promise to be as entertaining as the Big Short, but I’m gonna try.

### Question 5

Is there a minimum dollar amount you should start with?

Answer:

No.

Start with $1 and [Just Keep Buying](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Keep-Buying-Proven-wealth/dp/0857199250).

### Question 6

Can you approximate expected returns?

Answer:

Yes.

That is easy. When you get an MBA they teach you about the [Capital Asset Pricing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model), which is one of many _possible_ ways you could approximate returns.

However, I would say that forgot to include a word in your question.

_Can you **accurately** approximate expected returns?_

That is a much tricker question. Over a long-term, yes. A financial advisor can look at what kind of assets you own (stocks, bonds, your home, etc.) and provide reasonable forecasts on how their values will grow over long periods of time.

However, we experience life in short periods of time. Any forecast that may be reasonably accurate over 20 years, likely will be wrong if you look at it tomorrow.

Some firms can predict earnings accurately year-in-and-year-out. They are called hedge funds. They charge very high fees that may-or-may-not be worth it. If you want to better understand these, check out the book recommended below by Edward O. Thorp.

### Question 7

What are the main risks, if any?

Answer:

There are lots of risks. Too many to concisely list. That is how the system works, in fact. The higher the potential risk, the higher the potential reward is.

The worst case?

The worst case is awful.

It looks like this: complete financial ruin caused by someone committing a fraud. This is the land of Bernie Madoff and Sam Bankman Fried \[5\], where investors lose _**everything**_. One problem with finance is that it is always evolving. As it evolves, new products are offered to us to invest in.

_Our_ problem is that when we see something we perceive as new, our BS detectors become less calibrated. We aren’t sure what to compare it to, so things that are obvious frauds (at least in hindsight) slip through our mental filters and end up sounding like good ideas.

The second worse case started about 100 years ago, in October 1929. I’d argue that so many protections have been put in place, the conditions that caused and allowed the great depression to continue are unlikely to recur. This is not what I lose sleep over.

When it comes to _potential_ _bad shit_ happening, I think we need to worry more about fraud.

### Question 8

What are some good resources to learn more in depth on your own?

### Finally, Question 1

Where do I start?

Answer:

You’re thinking about it. You already have.

#### Notes:

\[1\] In this example, you’re savings rate is staying the same. You can really do some psychological magic if you get a 3-4% raise and bump your savings rate by 1% at the same time. I did this for a while, trying to reach the max 401(k) contribution. I backed off of my savings rate before maxing my 401(k), diverting the funds to a taxable brokerage account, because I preferred flexibility over tax savings. Generally, maxing your contribution is a good idea, but you should seek independent advice for your own situation.

\[2\] Clients of Fig Social Capital may own shares of Vanguard products in their portfolio.

\[3\] I am in no way associated with or paid by Vanguard. I just think they run a damn fine operation. There are many other great options out there. Look at several before deciding! Figure out what is important to _you_ and let that guide your choice. However, I’d urge you to avoid RobinHood for anything other than “fun money” and even then…

\[4\] I do not care for you opinions on my jib, unless you have at least $100M.

\[5\] In an unusual twist, Sam Bankman Fried may end up with his investors coming out whole, meaning they may [get their money back](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-05/ftx-might-have-found-some-money).
